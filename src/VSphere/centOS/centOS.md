CentOS stands for Community ENTerprise Operating System. It’s an acronym used in the names of the open source community, multiple working groups, and 2 Linux distros.

1. CentOS Stream
   - Is the upstream development platform for upcoming Red Hat® Enterprise Linux product releases.
2. CentOS
   - A community-supported and -produced Linux distro derived from source code released by Red Hat

CentOS itself belongs to Red Hat Enterprise Linux(RHEL), and will soon be an unmanaged and non-maintained distro.  We are learning CentOS because RHEL is farily common in the security domain. 

Because again this is a LINUX based OS, it's commands and feel will for most part be the same, a difference to note is that the package manager is different, you can use `yum` and `rpm`.

1. `yum`
  - stands for 'Yellow dog Updater, Modifier' which carries out the installation of packages on CentOS normally. `yum` can automatically calculate and resolve dependencies for a package which is going to be installed. The dependencies are also 'pulled'.

2. `rpm`
   - stands for 'Red Hat Package Manager' and is the container for software packages.
