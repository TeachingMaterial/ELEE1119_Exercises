<p>The Unix shell has been around longer than most of its users have been alive. It has survived because it’s a powerful tool that allows users to perform complex and powerful tasks, often with just a few keystrokes or lines of code. It helps users automate repetitive tasks and easily combine smaller tasks into larger, more powerful workflows.</p>
<p>Use of the shell is fundamental to a wide range of advanced computing tasks, including high-performance computing. These lessons will introduce you to this powerful tool.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This lesson guides you through the basics of file systems and the shell. If you have stored files on a computer at all and recognize the word “file” and either “directory” or “folder” (two common words for the same thing), you’re ready for this lesson.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you’re already comfortable manipulating files and directories, searching for files with grep and find, and writing simple loops and scripts, you probably want to explore the next lesson: <a href="Shell/../Shell_Extras/introduction.html">Shell Extras</a></p>

<h3 id="background"><a class="header" href="#background">Background</a></h3>
<p>Humans and computers commonly interact in many different ways, such as through a keyboard and mouse,
touch screen interfaces, or using speech recognition systems.
The most widely used way to interact with personal computers is called a
<strong>graphical user interface</strong> (GUI).</p>
<p>With a GUI, we give instructions by clicking a mouse and using menu-driven interactions. While the visual aid of a GUI makes it intuitive to learn, this way of delivering instructions to a computer scales very poorly.</p>
<p>Imagine the following task:</p>
<p>For a literature search, you have to copy the third line of one thousand text files in one thousand different directories and paste it into a single file. Using a GUI, you would not only be clicking at your desk for several hours, but you could potentially also commit an error in the process of completing this repetitive task. This is where we take advantage of the Unix shell.</p>
<p>The Unix shell is both a <strong>command-line interface</strong> (CLI) and a scripting language, allowing such repetitive tasks to be done automatically and fast.  With the proper commands, the shell can repeat tasks with or without some modification as many times as we want.</p>
<p>Using the shell, the task in the literature example can be accomplished in seconds.</p>
<h3 id="the-shell"><a class="header" href="#the-shell">The Shell</a></h3>
<p>The shell is a program where users can type commands. With the shell, it's possible to invoke complicated programs like climate modeling software or simple commands that create an empty directory with only one line of code.
The most popular Unix shell is Bash (the Bourne Again SHell --- so-called because it's derived from a shell written by Stephen Bourne).</p>
<p>Bash is the default shell on most modern implementations of Unix and in most packages that provide Unix-like tools for Windows.</p>
<p>Using the shell will take some effort and some time to learn. While a GUI presents you with choices to select, CLI choices are not automatically presented to you, so you must learn a few commands like new vocabulary in a language you're studying. However, unlike a spoken language, a small number of &quot;words&quot; (i.e. commands) gets you a long way, and we'll cover those essential few today.</p>
<p>The grammar of a shell allows you to combine existing tools into powerful pipelines and handle large volumes of data automatically. Sequences of commands can be written into a <em>script</em>, improving the reproducibility of workflows.</p>
<p>In addition, the command line is often the easiest way to interact with remote machines and supercomputers.</p>
<p>Familiarity with the shell is near essential to run a variety of specialized tools and resources including high-performance computing systems. </p>
<p>As clusters and cloud computing systems become more popular for scientific data crunching, being able to interact with the shell is becoming a necessary skill. We can build on the command-line skills covered here to tackle a wide range of scientific questions and computational challenges.</p>
<p>Let's get started.</p>
<p>When the shell is first opened, you are presented with a <strong>prompt</strong> indicating that the shell is waiting for input.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$
</code></pre>
<p>The shell typically uses <code>$ </code> as the prompt, but may use a different symbol. In the examples for this lesson, we'll show the prompt as <code>$ </code>.</p>
<p>Most importantly:</p>
<p>When typing commands, either from these lessons or from other sources <em>do not type the prompt</em>, only the commands that follow it. Also note that after you type a command, you have to press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to execute it.</p>
<p>The prompt is followed by a <strong>text cursor</strong>, a character that indicates the position where your typing will appear. The cursor is usually a flashing or solid block, but it can also be an underscore or a pipe. You may have seen it in a text editor program, for example.</p>
<p>So let's try our first command, <code>ls</code> which is short for listing.</p>
<p>This command will list the contents of the current directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">Desktop     Downloads   Movies      Pictures
Documents   Library     Music       Public
</code></pre>
<h2 id="command-not-found"><a class="header" href="#command-not-found">Command not found</a></h2>
<p>If the shell can't find a program whose name is the command you typed, it
will print an error message such as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ks
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">ks: command not found
</code></pre>
<p>This might happen if the command was mis-typed or if the program corresponding to that command is not installed.</p>
<h2 id="nelles-pipeline-a-typical-problem"><a class="header" href="#nelles-pipeline-a-typical-problem">Nelle's Pipeline: A Typical Problem</a></h2>

She needs to run these 1520 files through an imaginary program called <code>goostats.sh</code> she inherited. On top of this huge task, she has to write up results by the end of the month so her paper can appear in a special issue of <em>Aquatic Goo Letters</em>.</p>
<p>The bad news is that if she has to run <code>goostats.sh</code> by hand using a GUI, she'll have to select and open a file 1520 times. If <code>goostats.sh</code> takes 30 seconds to run each file, the whole process will take more than 12 hours of Nelle's attention.</p>
<p>With the shell, Nelle can instead assign her computer this mundane task while she focuses her attention on writing her paper.</p>
<p>The next few lessons will explore the ways Nelle can achieve this.
More specifically, they explain how she can use a command shell to run the <code>goostats.sh</code> program, using loops to automate the repetitive steps of entering file names, so that her computer can work while she writes her paper.</p>
<p>As a bonus, once she has put a processing pipeline together, she will be able to use it again whenever she collects more data.</p>
<p>In order to achieve her task, Nelle needs to know how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>navigate to a file/directory</li>
<li>create a file/directory</li>
<li>check the length of a file</li>
<li>chain commands together</li>
<li>retrieve a set of files</li>
<li>iterate over files</li>
<li>run a shell script containing her pipeline</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p>The part of the operating system responsible for managing files and directories is called the <strong>file system</strong>. It organizes our data into files, which hold information, and directories (also called 'folders'),
which hold files or other directories.</p>
<p>Several commands are frequently used to create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories. To start exploring them, we'll go to our open shell window.</p>
<p>First, let's find out where we are by running a command called <code>pwd</code>
(which stands for 'print working directory'). Directories are like <em>places</em> — at any time while we are using the shell, we are in exactly one place called our <strong>current working directory</strong>. </p>
<p>Commands mostly read and write files in the current working directory, i.e. 'here', so knowing where you are before running a command is important. <code>pwd</code> shows you where you are:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ pwd
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">/Users/nelle
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the computer's response is <code>/home/nelle</code>, which is Nelle's <strong>home directory</strong>:</p>
<h2 id="home-directory-variation"><a class="header" href="#home-directory-variation">Home Directory Variation</a></h2>
<p>The home directory path will look different on different operating systems. On MAC, it may look like <code>/Users/nelle</code>, and on Windows, it will be similar to:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>C:\Documents and Settings\nelle</code> or <code>C:\Users\nelle</code>.
(Note that it may look slightly different for different versions of Windows.)
&gt;&gt;</li>
<li>The assumption is, that your <code>pwd</code> command returns your user's home directory. 
&gt;&gt;</li>
<li>If <code>pwd</code> returns something different, you may need to navigate there using <code>cd</code> or some commands in this lesson will not work as written.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>See <a href="Shell/fileDir.html#exploring-other-directories">Exploring Other Directories</a> for more details on the <code>cd</code> command.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To understand what a 'home directory' is, let's have a look at how the file system as a whole is organized.  For the sake of this example, we'll be illustrating the filesystem on our scientist Nelle's computer.</p>
<p>After this illustration, you'll be learning commands to explore your own filesystem, which will be constructed in a similar way, but not be exactly identical.</p>
<p>On Nelle's computer, the filesystem looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="Shell/./fig/filesystem.svg" alt="The file system is made up of a root directory that contains sub-directories titled bin, data, users, and tmp" /></p>
<p>At the top is the <strong>root directory</strong> that holds everything else. We refer to it using a slash character, <code>/</code>, on its own; this character is the leading slash in <code>/Users/nelle</code>.</p>
<p>Inside that directory are several other directories:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bin</code> (which is where some built-in programs are stored),
&gt;&gt;</li>
<li><code>data</code> (for miscellaneous data files),
&gt;&gt;</li>
<li><code>Users</code> (where users' personal directories are located),
&gt;&gt;</li>
<li><code>tmp</code> (for temporary files that don't need to be stored long-term), and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>We know that our current working directory <code>/Users/nelle</code> is stored inside <code>/Users</code> because <code>/Users</code> is the first part of its name. Similarly, we know that <code>/Users</code> is stored inside the root directory <code>/</code> because its name begins with <code>/</code>.</p>
<h2 id="slashes"><a class="header" href="#slashes">Slashes</a></h2>
<p>Notice that there are two meanings for the <code>/</code> character. When it appears at the front of a file or directory name, it refers to the root directory. When it appears <em>inside</em> a path, it's just a separator.</p>
<p>Underneath <code>/Users</code>, we find one directory for each user with an account on Nelle's machine, her colleagues <em>imhotep</em> and <em>larry</em>.</p>
<p>Like other directories, home directories are sub-directories underneath <code>/Users</code> like <code>/Users/imhotep</code>, <code>/Users/larry</code> or <code>/Users/nelle</code>:</p>
<p><img src="Shell/fig/home-directories.svg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The user <em>imhotep</em>'s files are stored in <code>/Users/imhotep</code>, user <em>larry</em>'s in <code>/Users/larry</code>, and Nelle's in <code>/Users/nelle</code>.  Because Nelle is the user in these examples here, therefore <code>/Users/nelle</code> is the home directory.</p>
<p>Typically, when you open a new command prompt, you will be in your home directory to start.</p>
<p>Now let's learn the command that will let us see the contents of our own filesystem.  We can see what's in our home directory by running <code>ls</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">Applications Documents    Library      Music        Public
Desktop      Downloads    Movies       Pictures
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>(Again, your results may be slightly different depending on your operating system and how you have customized your filesystem.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>ls</code> prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory. We can make its output more comprehensible by using the <code>-F</code> <strong>option</strong> which tells <code>ls</code> to classify the output by adding a marker to file and directory names to indicate what they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>a trailing <code>/</code> indicates that this is a directory</li>
<li><code>@</code> indicates a link</li>
<li><code>*</code> indicates an executable</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on your shell's default settings, the shell might also use colors to indicate whether each entry is a file or directory.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls -F
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">Applications/ Documents/    Library/      Music/        Public/
Desktop/      Downloads/    Movies/       Pictures/
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we can see that our home directory contains only <strong>sub-directories</strong>. Any names in our output that don't have a classification symbol are plain old <strong>files</strong>.</p>

<p>If your screen gets too cluttered, you can clear your terminal using the <code>clear</code> command.

<h2 id="getting-help"><a class="header" href="#getting-help">Getting help</a></h2>
<p><code>ls</code> has lots of other <strong>options</strong>. There are two common ways to find out how to use a command and what options it accepts ---
<strong>depending on your environment, you might find that only one of these ways works:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We can pass a <code>--help</code> option to the command (not available on macOS), such as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls --help
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can read its manual with <code>man</code> (not available in Git Bash, or this version of JuypterHub due to available space), such as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ man ls
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Both ways are describe next.</p>
<h4 id="the---help-option"><a class="header" href="#the---help-option">The <code>--help</code> option</a></h4>
<p>Most bash commands and programs that people have written to be run from within bash, support a <code>--help</code> option that displays more information on how to use the command or program.</p>

<p>You can also use two options at the same time. What does the command <code>ls</code> do when used with the <code>-l</code> option? </p>
<p>What about if you use both the <code>-l</code> and the <code>-h</code> option?</p>
<p>Some of its output is about properties that we do not cover in this lesson (such as file permissions and ownership), but the rest should be useful nevertheless.</p>
<p>The <code>-l</code> option makes <code>ls</code> use a <strong>l</strong>ong listing format, showing not only the file/directory names but also additional information, such as the file size and the time of its last modification. </p>
<p>If you use both the <code>-h</code> option and the <code>-l</code> option, this makes the file size '<strong>h</strong>uman readable', i.e. displaying something like <code>5.3K</code> instead of <code>5369</code>.</p>
<h2 id="listing-in-reverse-chronological-order"><a class="header" href="#listing-in-reverse-chronological-order">Listing in Reverse Chronological Order</a></h2>
<p>By default, <code>ls</code> lists the contents of a directory in alphabetical order by name. The command <code>ls -t</code> lists items by time of last change instead of alphabetically. The command <code>ls -r</code> lists the contents of a directory in reverse order. Which file is displayed last when you combine the <code>-t</code> and <code>-r</code> options?</p>

<h3 id="exploring-other-directories"><a class="header" href="#exploring-other-directories">Exploring Other Directories</a></h3>
<p>Not only can we use <code>ls</code> on the current working directory, but we can use it to list the contents of a different directory.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at our <code>Desktop</code> directory by running <code>ls -F Desktop</code>, i.e., the command <code>ls</code> with the <code>-F</code> <strong>option</strong> and the [<strong>argument</strong>][Arguments]  <code>Desktop</code>.</p>
<p>The argument <code>Desktop</code> tells <code>ls</code> that we want a listing of something other than our current working directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls -F Desktop
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">shell-lesson-data/
</code></pre>
<p>Note that if a directory named <code>Desktop</code> does not exist in your current working directory, this command will return an error. Typically, a <code>Desktop</code> directory exists in your home directory, which we assume is the current working directory of your bash shell.</p>
<p>Your output should be a list of all the files and sub-directories in your Desktop directory, including the <code>shell-lesson-data</code> directory you downloaded the <a href="Shell/./installation.html">setup for this lesson</a>.</p>
<p>On many systems, the command line Desktop directory is the same as your GUI Desktop.</p>
<p>Take a look at your Desktop to confirm that your output is accurate.</p>
<p>As you may now see, using a bash shell is strongly dependent on the idea that your files are organized in a hierarchical file system.</p>
<p>Organizing things hierarchically in this way helps us keep track of our work:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's possible to put hundreds of files in our home directory,</li>
<li>Just as it's possible to pile hundreds of printed papers on our desk, but it's a self-defeating strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we know the <code>shell-lesson-data</code> directory is located in our Desktop directory, we can do two things.</p>
<p>First, we can look at its contents, using the same strategy as before, passing a directory name to <code>ls</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls -F Desktop/shell-lesson-data
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">exercise-data/  north-pacific-gyre/
</code></pre>
<p>Second, we can actually change our location to a different directory, so we are no longer located in our home directory.</p>
<p>The command to change locations is <code>cd</code> followed by a directory name to change our working directory.
<code>cd</code> stands for 'change directory', which is a bit misleading:</p>
<ul>
<li>The command doesn't change the directory;
<ul>
<li>It changes the shell's idea of what directory we are in.</li>
<li>The <code>cd</code> command is akin to double clicking a folder in a graphical interface to get into a folder.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's say we want to move to the <code>data</code> directory we saw above. We can use the following series of commands to get there:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cd Desktop
$ cd shell-lesson-data
$ cd exercise-data
</code></pre>
<p>These commands will move us from our home directory into our Desktop directory, then into the <code>shell-lesson-data</code> directory, then into the <code>exercise-data</code> directory.
You will notice that <code>cd</code> doesn't print anything. This is normal. Many shell commands will not output anything to the screen when successfully executed. But if we run <code>pwd</code> after it, we can see that we are now in <code>/Users/nelle/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data</code>.</p>
<p>If we run <code>ls -F</code> without arguments now, it lists the contents of <code>/Users/nelle/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data</code>, because that's where we now are:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ pwd
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">/Users/nelle/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data
</code></pre>
<p>...</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls -F
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">animal-counts/  creatures/  numbers.txt  proteins/  writing/
</code></pre>
<p>We now know how to go down the directory tree (i.e. how to go into a subdirectory), but how do we go up (i.e. how do we leave a directory and go into its parent directory)? </p>
<p>We might try the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cd shell-lesson-data
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">-bash: cd: shell-lesson-data: No such file or directory
</code></pre>
<p>But we get an error! Why is this?</p>
<p>With our methods so far, <code>cd</code> can only see sub-directories inside your current directory. There are different ways to see directories above your current location; we'll start with the simplest.</p>
<p>There is a shortcut in the shell to move up one directory level that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cd ..
</code></pre>
<p><code>..</code> is a special directory name meaning &quot;the directory containing this one&quot;,
or more succinctly, the <strong>parent</strong> of the current directory.</p>
<p>Sure enough, if we run <code>pwd</code> after running <code>cd ..</code>, we're back in <code>/Users/nelle/Desktop/shell-lesson-data</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ pwd
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">/Users/nelle/Desktop/shell-lesson-data
</code></pre>
<p>The special directory <code>..</code> doesn't usually show up when we run <code>ls</code>. If we want to display it, we can add the <code>-a</code> option to <code>ls -F</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls -F -a
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">./  ../  exercise-data/  north-pacific-gyre/
</code></pre>
<p><code>-a</code> stands for 'show all';</p>
<ul>
<li>it forces <code>ls</code> to show us file and directory names that begin with <code>.</code>,
such as <code>..</code> (which, if we're in <code>/Users/nelle</code>, refers to the <code>/Users</code> directory).</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, it also displays another special directory that's just called <code>.</code>, which means 'the current working directory'.</p>
<p>It may seem redundant to have a name for it, but we'll see some uses for it soon.</p>
<p>Note that in most command line tools, multiple options can be combined with a single <code>-</code> and no spaces between the options: <code>ls -F -a</code> is equivalent to <code>ls -Fa</code>.</p>
<h2 id="other-hidden-files"><a class="header" href="#other-hidden-files">Other Hidden Files</a></h2>
<p>In addition to the hidden directories <code>..</code> and <code>.</code>, you may also see a file called <code>.bash_profile</code>. This file usually contains shell configuration settings. You may also see other files and directories beginning with <code>.</code>.</p>
<p>These are usually files and directories that are used to configure different programs on your computer. The prefix <code>.</code> is used to prevent these configuration files from cluttering the terminal when a standard <code>ls</code> command is used.</p>
<p>These three commands are the basic commands for navigating the filesystem on your computer:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pwd</code>, <code>ls</code>, and <code>cd</code>. </li>
</ul>
<p>Let's explore some variations on those commands. What happens if you type <code>cd</code> on its own, without giving
a directory?</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cd
</code></pre>
<p>How can you check what happened? <code>pwd</code> gives us the answer!</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ pwd
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">/Users/nelle
</code></pre>
<p>It turns out that <code>cd</code> without an argument will return you to your home directory, which is great if you've got lost in your own filesystem.</p>
<p>Let's try returning to the <code>exercise-data</code> directory from before. Last time, we used three commands, but we can actually string together the list of directories to move to <code>exercise-data</code> in one step:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cd Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data
</code></pre>
<p>Check that we've moved to the right place by running <code>pwd</code> and <code>ls -F</code>.</p>
<p>If we want to move up one level from the data directory, we could use <code>cd ..</code>.  But there is another way to move to any directory, regardless of your current location.</p>
<p>So far, when specifying directory names, or even a directory path (as above), we have been using <strong>relative paths</strong>.  When you use a relative path with a command like <code>ls</code> or <code>cd</code>, it tries to find that location from where we are, rather than from the root of the file system.</p>
<p>However, it is possible to specify the <strong>absolute path</strong> to a directory by including its entire path from the root directory, which is indicated by a leading slash. The leading <code>/</code> tells the computer to follow the path from the root of the file system, so it always refers to exactly one directory, no matter where we are when we run the command.</p>
<p>This allows us to move to our <code>shell-lesson-data</code> directory from anywhere on the filesystem (including from inside <code>exercise-data</code>). To find the absolute path we're looking for, we can use <code>pwd</code> and then extract the piece we need to move to <code>shell-lesson-data</code>.</p>

<h2 id="two-more-shortcuts"><a class="header" href="#two-more-shortcuts">Two More Shortcuts</a></h2>
<p>The shell interprets a tilde (<code>~</code>) character at the start of a path to mean &quot;the current user's home directory&quot;. For example, if Nelle's home directory is <code>/Users/nelle</code>, then <code>~/data</code> is equivalent to <code>/Users/nelle/data</code>. This only works if it is the first character in the path: </p>
<ul>
<li><code>here/there/~/elsewhere</code> is <em>not</em> <code>here/there/Users/nelle/elsewhere</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another shortcut is the <code>-</code> (dash) character. <code>cd</code> will translate <code>-</code> into <em>the previous directory I was in</em>, which is faster than having to remember, then type, the full path.  This is a <em>very</em> efficient way of moving <em>back and forth between two directories</em> -- i.e. if you execute <code>cd -</code> twice, you end up back in the starting directory.</p>
<p>The difference between <code>cd ..</code> and <code>cd -</code> is that the former brings you <em>up</em>, while the latter brings you <em>back</em>.</p>
<p>Try it!</p>
<p>First navigate to <code>~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data</code> (you should already be there.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data
</code></pre>
<p>Then <code>cd</code> into the <code>exercise-data/creatures</code> directory</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cd exercise-data/creatures
</code></pre>
<p>Now if you run</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cd -
</code></pre>
<p>You'll see you're back in <code>~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data</code>.</p>
<p>Run <code>cd -</code> again and you're back in <code>~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/creatures</code></p>

<h2 id="general-syntax-of-a-shell-command"><a class="header" href="#general-syntax-of-a-shell-command">General Syntax of a Shell Command</a></h2>
<p>We have now encountered commands, options, and arguments, but it is perhaps useful to formalise some terminology.</p>
<p>Consider the command below as a general example of a command, which we will dissect into its component parts:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls -F /
</code></pre>
<p><img src="Shell/fig/shell_command_syntax.svg" alt="General syntax of a shell command" /></p>
<p><code>ls</code> is the <strong>command</strong>, with an <strong>option</strong> <code>-F</code> and an <strong>argument</strong> <code>/</code>.</p>
<p>We've already encountered options  which either start with a single dash (<code>-</code>) or two dashes (<code>--</code>), and they change the behavior of a command.</p>
<p>[Arguments] tell the command what to operate on (e.g. files and directories).
Sometimes options and arguments are referred to as <strong>parameters</strong>.</p>
<p>A command can be called with more than one option and more than one argument, but a command doesn't always require an argument or an option.</p>
<p>You might sometimes see options being referred to as <strong>switches</strong> or <strong>flags</strong>, especially for options that take no argument. In this lesson we will stick with using the term <em>option</em>.</p>
<p>Each part is separated by spaces: if you omit the space between <code>ls</code> and <code>-F</code> the shell will look for a command called <code>ls-F</code>, which doesn't exist. Also, capitalization can be important. </p>
<p>For example, <code>ls -s</code> will display the size of files and directories alongside the names, while <code>ls -S</code> will sort the files and directories by size, as shown below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data
$ ls -s exercise-data
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">total 28
 4 animal-counts   4 creatures  12 numbers.txt   4 proteins   4 writing
</code></pre>
<p>...</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls -S exercise-data
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">animal-counts  creatures  proteins  writing  numbers.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Putting all that together, our command above gives us a listing of files and directories in the root directory <code>/</code>.</p>
<p>An example of the output you might get from the above command is given below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls -F /
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">Applications/         System/
Library/              Users/
Network/              Volumes/
</code></pre>
<h3 id="nelles-pipeline-organizing-files"><a class="header" href="#nelles-pipeline-organizing-files">Nelle's Pipeline: Organizing Files</a></h3>
<p>Knowing this much about files and directories, Nelle is ready to organize the files that the protein assay machine will create.</p>
<p>She creates a directory called <code>north-pacific-gyre</code> (to remind herself where the data came from), which will contain the data files from the assay machine, and her data processing scripts.</p>
<p>Each of her physical samples is labelled according to her lab's convention with a unique ten-character ID, such as 'NENE01729A'.</p>
<p>This ID is what she used in her collection log to record the location, time, depth, and other characteristics of the sample, so she decides to use it as part of each data file's name.</p>
<p>Since the assay machine's output is plain text, she will call her files <code>NENE01729A.txt</code>, <code>NENE01812A.txt</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>All 1520 files will go into the same directory.</p>
<p>Now in her current directory <code>shell-lesson-data</code>, Nelle can see what files she has using the command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls north-pacific-gyre/
</code></pre>
<p>This command is a lot to type, but she can let the shell do most of the work through what is called <strong>tab completion</strong>.</p>
<p>If she types:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls nor
</code></pre>
<p>and then presses <kbd>Tab</kbd> (the tab key on her keyboard), the shell automatically completes the directory name for her: </p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls north-pacific-gyre/
</code></pre>
<p>Pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> again does nothing, since there are multiple possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> twice brings up a list of all the files.</li>
</ul>
<p>If Nelle adds <kbd>G</kbd> and presses <kbd>Tab</kbd> again, the shell will append 'goo' since all files that start with 'g' share the first three characters 'goo'.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls north-pacific-gyre/goo
</code></pre>
<p>To see all of those files, she can press <kbd>Tab</kbd> twice more.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">ls north-pacific-gyre/goo
goodiff.sh   goostats.sh
</code></pre>
<p>This is called <strong>tab completion</strong>, and we will see it in many other tools as we go on.</p>

<h2 id="creating-directories"><a class="header" href="#creating-directories">Creating directories</a></h2>
<p>We now know how to explore files and directories,
but how do we create them in the first place?</p>
<p>In this episode we will learn about creating and moving files and directories,
using the <code>exercise-data/writing</code> directory as an example.</p>
<h3 id="step-one-see-where-we-are-and-what-we-already-have"><a class="header" href="#step-one-see-where-we-are-and-what-we-already-have">Step one: see where we are and what we already have</a></h3>
<p>We should still be in the <code>shell-lesson-data</code> directory on the Desktop, which we can checking using:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ pwd
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">/Users/nelle/Desktop/shell-lesson-data
</code></pre>
<p>Next we'll move to the <code>exercise-data/writing</code> directory and see what it contains:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cd exercise-data/writing/
</code></pre>
<p>...</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls -F
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">haiku.txt  LittleWomen.txt
</code></pre>
<h3 id="create-a-directory"><a class="header" href="#create-a-directory">Create a directory</a></h3>
<p>Let's create a new directory called <code>thesis</code> using the command <code>mkdir thesis</code>
(which has no output):</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ mkdir thesis
</code></pre>
<p>As you might guess from its name, <code>mkdir</code> means 'make directory'.
Since <code>thesis</code> is a relative path (i.e., does not have a leading slash, like <code>/what/ever/thesis</code>), the new directory is created in the current working directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls -F
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">haiku.txt  LittleWomen.txt  thesis/
</code></pre>
<p>Since we've just created the <code>thesis</code> directory, there's nothing in it yet:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls -F thesis
</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>mkdir</code> is not limited to creating single directories one at a time.</p>
<p>The <code>-p</code> option allows <code>mkdir</code> to create a directory with nested subdirectories in a single operation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ mkdir -p ../project/data ../project/results
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-R</code> option to the <code>ls</code> command will list all nested subdirectories within a directory. Let's use <code>ls -FR</code> to recursively list the new directory hierarchy we just created in the <code>project</code> directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls -FR ../project
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">../project/:
data/  results/

../project/data:

../project/results:
</code></pre>

<p>Using the shell to create a directory is no different than using a file explorer. If you open the current directory using your operating system's graphical file explorer, the <code>thesis</code> directory will appear there too.</p>
<p>While the shell and the file explorer are two different ways of interacting with the files, the files and directories themselves are the same.</p>
<h2 id="good-names-for-files-and-directories"><a class="header" href="#good-names-for-files-and-directories">Good names for files and directories</a></h2>
<p>Complicated names of files and directories can make your life painful when working on the command line. Here we provide a few useful tips for the names of your files and directories.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Don't use spaces.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spaces can make a name more meaningful, but since spaces are used to separate arguments on the command line it is better to avoid them in names of files and directories.</li>
<li>You can use <code>-</code> or <code>_</code> instead (e.g. <code>north-pacific-gyre/</code> rather than <code>north pacific gyre/</code>).</li>
<li>To test this out, try typing <code>mkdir north pacific gyre</code>and see what directory (or directories!) are made when you check with <code>ls -F</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't begin the name with <code>-</code> (dash).</p>
<ul>
<li>Commands treat names starting with <code>-</code> as options.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stick with letters, numbers, <code>.</code> (period or 'full stop'), <code>-</code> (dash) and <code>_</code> (underscore).</p>
<ul>
<li>Many other characters have special meanings on the command line.</li>
<li>We will learn about some of these during this lesson.</li>
<li>There are special characters that can cause your command to not work as expected and can even result in data loss.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you need to refer to names of files or directories that have spaces &gt; or other special characters, you should surround the name in quotes (<code>&quot;&quot;</code>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="create-a-text-file"><a class="header" href="#create-a-text-file">Create a text file</a></h3>
<p>Let's change our working directory to <code>thesis</code> using <code>cd</code>,
then run a text editor called Nano to create a file called <code>draft.txt</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cd thesis
$ nano draft.txt
</code></pre>
<h2 id="which-editor"><a class="header" href="#which-editor">Which Editor?</a></h2>
<p>When we say, '<code>nano</code> is a text editor' we really do mean 'text': it can only work with plain character data, not tables, images, or any other human-friendly media. We use it in examples because it is one of the least complex text editors. However, because of this trait, it may not be powerful enough or flexible enough for the work you need to do after this workshop. On Unix systems (such as Linux and macOS), many programmers use <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> or <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> (both of which require more time to learn), or a graphical editor such as
<a href="http://projects.gnome.org/g3edit/">Gedit</a>. On Windows, you may wish to use <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>.  Windows also has a built-in editor called <code>notepad</code> that can be run from the command line in the same way as <code>nano</code> for the purposes of this lesson.</p>
<p>No matter what editor you use, you will need to know where it searches for and saves files. If you start it from the shell, it will (probably) use your current working directory as its default location. If you use your computer's start menu, it may want to save files in your desktop or  ocuments directory instead. You can change this by navigating to another directory the first time you 'Save As...'</p>
<p>Let's type in a few lines of text. Once we're happy with our text, we can press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> (press the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Control</kbd> key and, while holding it down, press the <kbd>O</kbd> key) to write our data to disk (we'll be asked what file we want to save this to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Press <kbd>Return</kbd> to accept the suggested default of <code>draft.txt</code>).</li>
</ul>
<div style="width:80%; margin: auto;"><img alt="screenshot of nano text editor in action"
src="fig/nano-screenshot.png"></div>
<p>Once our file is saved, we can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> to quit the editor and
return to the shell.</p>
<h2 id="control-ctrl-or--key"><a class="header" href="#control-ctrl-or--key">Control, Ctrl, or ^ Key</a></h2>
<p>The Control key is also called the 'Ctrl' key. There are various ways in which using the Control key may be described. For example, you may see an instruction to press the <kbd>Control</kbd> key and, while holding it down, press the <kbd>X</kbd> key, described as any of:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Control-X</code></li>
<li><code>Control+X</code></li>
<li><code>Ctrl-X</code></li>
<li><code>Ctrl+X</code></li>
<li><code>^X</code></li>
<li><code>C-x</code></li>
</ul>
<p>In nano, along the bottom of the screen you'll see <code>^G Get Help ^O WriteOut</code>.</p>
<p>This means that you can use <code>Control-G</code> to get help and <code>Control-O</code> to save your file.</p>
<p><code>nano</code> doesn't leave any output on the screen after it exits, but <code>ls</code> now shows that we have created a file called <code>draft.txt</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">draft.txt
</code></pre>
<h2 id="creating-files-a-different-way"><a class="header" href="#creating-files-a-different-way">Creating Files a Different Way</a></h2>
<p>We have seen how to create text files using the <code>nano</code> editor.</p>
<p>Now, try the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ touch my_file.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Answer these four questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What did the <code>touch</code> command do?
&gt;&gt;</li>
<li>When you look at your current directory using the GUI file explorer,
does the file show up?
&gt;&gt;</li>
<li>Use <code>ls -l</code> to inspect the files.  How large is <code>my_file.txt</code>?
&gt;&gt;</li>
<li>When might you want to create a file this way?</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<details>
<summary><b>Click for solutions</b></summary>
 <p></p>  
<ol>
<li>The <code>touch</code> command generates a new file called <code>my_file.txt</code> in your current directory.  You can observe this newly generated file by typing <code>ls</code> at the command line prompt.  <code>my_file.txt</code> can also be viewed in your GUI file explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>  
<ol start="20">
<li>When you inspect the file with <code>ls -l</code>, note that the size of <code>my_file.txt</code> is 0 bytes.  In other words, it contains no data. If you open <code>my_file.txt</code> using your text editor it is blank.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>  
<ol start="3">
<li>Some programs do not generate output files themselves, but instead require that empty files have already been generated. When the program is run, it searches for an existing file to populate with its output.  The touch command allows you to efficiently generate a blank text file to be used by such programs.</li>
</ol>
</details>
<hr />
<h2 id="whats-in-a-name"><a class="header" href="#whats-in-a-name">What's In A Name?</a></h2>
<p>You may have noticed that all of Nelle's files are named 'something dot something', and in this part of the lesson, we always used the extension <code>.txt</code>. </p>
<p>This is just a convention: </p>
<ul>
<li>We can call a file <code>mythesis</code> or almost anything else we want. However, most people use two-part names most of the time to help them (and their programs) tell different kinds of files apart. </li>
</ul>
<p>The second part of such a name is called the <strong>filename extension</strong> and indicates what type of data the file holds:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.txt</code> signals a plain text file, </li>
<li><code>.pdf</code> indicates a PDF document, </li>
<li><code>.cfg</code> is a configuration file full of parameters for some program or other, </li>
<li><code>.png</code> is a PNG image, and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a convention, albeit an important one. Files contain bytes: it's up to us and our programs to interpret those bytes according to the rules for plain text files, PDF documents, configuration files, images, and so on.</p>
<p>Naming a PNG image of a whale as <code>whale.mp3</code> doesn't somehow magically turn it into a recording of whale song, though it <em>might</em> cause the operating system to try to open it with a music player when someone double-clicks it.</p>
<h2 id="moving-files-and-directories"><a class="header" href="#moving-files-and-directories">Moving files and directories</a></h2>
<p>Returning to the <code>shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/writing</code> directory,</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/writing
</code></pre>
<p>In our <code>thesis</code> directory we have a file <code>draft.txt</code> which isn't a particularly informative name, so let's change the file's name using <code>mv</code>, which is short for 'move':</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ mv thesis/draft.txt thesis/quotes.txt
</code></pre>
<p>The first argument tells <code>mv</code> what we're 'moving', while the second is where it's to go. In this case, we're moving <code>thesis/draft.txt</code> to <code>thesis/quotes.txt</code>, which has the same effect as renaming the file.</p>
<p>Sure enough, <code>ls</code> shows us that <code>thesis</code> now contains one file called <code>quotes.txt</code>:</p>

<p>One must be careful when specifying the target file name, since <code>mv</code> will silently overwrite any existing file with the same name, which could lead to data loss. An additional option, <code>mv -i</code> (or <code>mv --interactive</code>), can be used to make <code>mv</code> ask you for confirmation before overwriting.</p>
<p>Note that <code>mv</code> also works on directories.</p>
<p>Let's move <code>quotes.txt</code> into the current working directory.</p>
<p>We use <code>mv</code> once again, but this time we'll use just the name of a directory as the second argument to tell <code>mv</code> that we want to keep the filename but put the file somewhere new.
(This is why the command is called 'move'.)</p>
<p>In this case, the directory name we use is the special directory name <code>.</code> that we mentioned earlier.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ mv thesis/quotes.txt .
</code></pre>
<p>The effect is to move the file from the directory it was in to the current working directory. </p>
<p><code>ls</code> now shows us that <code>thesis</code> is empty:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls thesis
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, we can confirm the file <code>quotes.txt</code> is no longer present in the <code>thesis</code> directory by explicitly trying to list it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls thesis/quotes.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">ls: cannot access 'thesis/quotes.txt': No such file or directory
</code></pre>
<p><code>ls</code> with a filename or directory as an argument only lists the requested file or directory.</p>
<p>If the file given as the argument doesn't exist, the shell returns an error as we saw above.</p>
<p>We can use this to see that <code>quotes.txt</code> is now present in our current directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls quotes.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">quotes.txt

<p>The <code>cp</code> command works very much like <code>mv</code>, except it copies a file instead of moving it. We can check that it did the right thing using <code>ls</code> with two paths as arguments --- like most Unix commands, <code>ls</code> can be given multiple paths at once:</p>

$ ls quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt

<p>Output:</p>

<p>We can also copy a directory and all its contents by using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion">recursive</a> option <code>-r</code>, e.g. to back up a directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cp -r thesis thesis_backup

<strong>Explanation:</strong>
We start in the <code>/Users/jamie/data</code> directory, and create a new folder called <code>recombined</code>. </li>
</ol>
<p>The second line moves (<code>mv</code>) the file <code>proteins.dat</code> to the new folder (<code>recombined</code>).</p>

<ul>
<li>The tricky part here is where the file was copied to.</li>
<li>Recall that <code>..</code> means 'go up a level', so the copied file is now in <code>/Users/jamie</code>.</li>
<li>Notice that <code>..</code> is interpreted with respect to the current working

<p>The <code>-i</code> option will prompt before (every) removal (use <kbd>Y</kbd> to confirm deletion or <kbd>N</kbd> to keep the file). The Unix shell doesn't have a trash bin, so all the files removed will disappear forever.

<h3 id="wildcards"><a class="header" href="#wildcards">Wildcards</a></h3>
<p><code>*</code> is a <strong>wildcard</strong>, which matches zero or more  characters. Let's consider the <code>shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/proteins</code> directory:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>*.pdb</code> matches <code>ethane.pdb</code>, <code>propane.pdb</code>, and every
file that ends with '.pdb'. 
&gt;&gt;</li>
<li>On the other hand, <code>p*.pdb</code> only matches <code>pentane.pdb</code> and <code>propane.pdb</code>, because the 'p' at the front only matches filenames that begin with the letter 'p'.
&gt;&gt; 
<code>?</code> is also a wildcard, but it matches exactly one character.
&gt;&gt;</li>
<li>So <code>?ethane.pdb</code> would match <code>methane.pdb</code> 
&gt;&gt;</li>
<li>whereas <code>*ethane.pdb</code> matches both <code>ethane.pdb</code>, and <code>methane.pdb</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wildcards can be used in combination with each other e.g. <code>???ane.pdb</code> matches three characters followed by <code>ane.pdb</code>, giving <code>cubane.pdb  ethane.pdb  octane.pdb</code>.</p>
<p>When the shell sees a wildcard, it expands the wildcard to create a list of matching filenames <em>before</em> running the command that was asked for. As an exception, if a wildcard expression does not match any file, Bash will pass the expression as an argument to the command as it is.</p>
<p>For example, typing <code>ls *.pdf</code> in the <code>proteins</code> directory (which contains only files with names ending with <code>.pdb</code>) results in an error message that there is no file called <code>*.pdf</code>. </p>
<p>However, generally commands like <code>wc</code> and <code>ls</code> see the lists of
file names matching these expressions, but not the wildcards
themselves. It is the shell, not the other programs, that deals with
expanding wildcards.</p>
<h3 id="list-filenames-matching-a-pattern"><a class="header" href="#list-filenames-matching-a-pattern">List filenames matching a pattern</a></h3>
<p>When run in the <code>proteins</code> directory, which <code>ls</code> command(s) will produce this output <code>ethane.pdb  methane.pdb</code> ?</p>
<ol>
<li><code>ls *t*ane.pdb</code>
&gt;&gt;</li>
<li><code>ls *t?ne.*</code>

<p>The solution is <code>3.</code></p>
<p><code>1.</code> shows all files whose names contain zero or more characters (<code>*</code>) followed by the letter <code>t</code>, then zero or more characters (<code>*</code>) followed by <code>ane.pdb</code>.
&gt;&gt;</p>
<ul>
<li>This gives <code>ethane.pdb  methane.pdb  octane.pdb  pentane.pdb</code>.
&gt;&gt;
<code>2.</code> shows all files whose names start with zero or more characters (<code>*</code>) followed by the letter <code>t</code>, then a single character (<code>?</code>), then <code>ne.</code> followed by zero or more characters (<code>*</code>).
&gt;&gt;</li>
<li>This will give us <code>octane.pdb</code> and <code>pentane.pdb</code> but doesn't match anything which ends in <code>thane.pdb</code>.
&gt;&gt;
<code>3.</code> fixes the problems of option 2 by matching two characters (<code>??</code>) between <code>t</code> and <code>ne</code>. <strong>This is the solution.</strong>

<hr />
<p>Now that we know a few basic commands, we can finally look at the shell's most powerful feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>the ease with which it lets us combine existing programs in new ways.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll start with the directory <code>shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/proteins</code> that contains six files describing some simple organic molecules.</p>
<p>The <code>.pdb</code> extension indicates that these files are in Protein Data Bank format, a simple text format that specifies the type and position of each atom in the molecule.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls proteins
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cubane.pdb    methane.pdb    pentane.pdb
ethane.pdb    octane.pdb     propane.pdb
</code></pre>
<p>Let's go into that directory with <code>cd</code> and run an example  command <code>wc cubane.pdb</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cd proteins
$ wc cubane.pdb
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">20  156 1158 cubane.pdb
</code></pre>
<p><code>wc</code> is the 'word count' command:</p>
<ul>
<li>it counts the number of lines, words, and characters in files (from left to right, in that order).</li>
</ul>
<p>If we run the command <code>wc *.pdb</code>, the <code>*</code> in <code>*.pdb</code> matches zero or more characters, so the shell turns <code>*.pdb</code> into a list of all <code>.pdb</code> files in the current directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ wc *.pdb
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">  20  156  1158  cubane.pdb
  12  84   622   ethane.pdb
   9  57   422   methane.pdb
  30  246  1828  octane.pdb
  21  165  1226  pentane.pdb
  15  111  825   propane.pdb
 107  819  6081  total
</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>wc *.pdb</code> also shows the total number of all lines in the last line of the output.</p>
<p>If we run <code>wc -l</code> instead of just <code>wc</code>, the output shows only the number of lines per file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ wc -l *.pdb
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">  20  cubane.pdb
  12  ethane.pdb
   9  methane.pdb
  30  octane.pdb
  21  pentane.pdb
  15  propane.pdb
 107  total
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-m</code> and <code>-w</code> options can also be used with the <code>wc</code> command, to show only the number of characters or the number of words in the files.</p>
<h2 id="why-isnt-it-doing-anything"><a class="header" href="#why-isnt-it-doing-anything">Why Isn't It Doing Anything?</a></h2>
<p>What happens if a command is supposed to process a file, but we don't give it a filename? For example, what if we type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ wc -l
</code></pre>
<p>... but don't type <code>*.pdb</code> (or anything else) after the command?</p>
<p>Since it doesn't have any filenames, <code>wc</code> assumes it is supposed to process input given at the command prompt, so it just sits there and waits for us to give it some data interactively. From the outside, though, all we see is it
sitting there: the command doesn't appear to do anything.</p>
<p>If you make this kind of mistake, you can escape out of this state by holding down the control key (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>) and typing the letter <kbd>C</kbd> once and letting go of the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key. <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> </p>
<h2 id="capturing-output-from-commands"><a class="header" href="#capturing-output-from-commands">Capturing output from commands</a></h2>
<p>Which of these files contains the fewest lines?</p>
<p>It's an easy question to answer when there are only six files, but what if there were 6000?</p>
<p>Our first step toward a solution is to run the command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ wc -l *.pdb &gt; lengths.txt
</code></pre>
<p>The greater than symbol, <code>&gt;</code>, tells the shell to <strong>redirect</strong> the command's output to a file instead of printing it to the screen. (This is why there is no screen output:</p>
<ul>
<li>everything that <code>wc</code> would have printed has gone into the file <code>lengths.txt</code> instead.)</li>
<li>The shell will create the file if it doesn't exist. If the file exists, it will be silently overwritten, which may lead to data loss and thus requires some caution.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>ls lengths.txt</code> confirms that the file exists:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls lengths.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">lengths.txt
</code></pre>
<p>We can now send the content of <code>lengths.txt</code> to the screen using <code>cat lengths.txt</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>cat</code> command gets its name from 'concatenate' i.e. join together, and it prints the contents of files one after another.</p>
<p>There's only one file in this case, so <code>cat</code> just shows us what it contains:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cat lengths.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">  20  cubane.pdb
  12  ethane.pdb
   9  methane.pdb
  30  octane.pdb
  21  pentane.pdb
  15  propane.pdb
 107  total
</code></pre>
<h2 id="output-page-by-page"><a class="header" href="#output-page-by-page">Output Page by Page</a></h2>
<p>We'll continue to use <code>cat</code> in this lesson, for convenience and consistency, but it has the disadvantage that it always dumps the whole file onto your screen.</p>
<p>More useful in practice is the command <code>less</code>, which you use with <code>less lengths.txt</code>. This displays a screenful of the file, and then stops. You can go forward one screenful by pressing the spacebar, or back one by pressing <code>b</code>. </p>
<p>Press <code>q</code> to quit.</p>
<h2 id="filtering-output"><a class="header" href="#filtering-output">Filtering output</a></h2>
<p>Next we'll use the <code>sort</code> command to sort the contents of the <code>lengths.txt</code> file.</p>
<p>But first we'll use an exercise to learn a little about the sort command:</p>
<h2 id="what-does-sort--n-do"><a class="header" href="#what-does-sort--n-do">What Does <code>sort -n</code> Do?</a></h2>
<p>The file <code>shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/numbers.txt</code> contains the following lines:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">10
2
19
22
6
</code></pre>
<p>If we run <code>sort</code> on this file, the output is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">10
19
2
22
6
</code></pre>
<p>If we run <code>sort -n</code> on the same file, we get this instead:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">2

10
19

</code></pre>
<p>Explain why <code>-n</code> has this effect.</p>

<details>
<summary><b>Click to see Solution</b></summary>
<p></p>
<p>The <code>-n</code> option specifies a numerical rather than an alphanumerical sort.</p>
</details>
<hr />
<p>We will also use the <code>-n</code> option to specify that the sort is numerical instead of alphanumerical. </p>
<p>This does <em>not</em> change the file; instead, it sends the sorted result to the screen:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ sort -n lengths.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">  9  methane.pdb
 12  ethane.pdb
 15  propane.pdb
 20  cubane.pdb
 21  pentane.pdb
 30  octane.pdb
107  total
</code></pre>
<p>We can put the sorted list of lines in another temporary file called <code>sorted-lengths.txt</code> by putting <code>&gt; sorted-lengths.txt</code> after the command,just as we used <code>&gt; lengths.txt</code> to put the output of <code>wc</code> into <code>lengths.txt</code>.</p>
<p>Once we've done that, we can run another command called <code>head</code> to get the first few lines in <code>sorted-lengths.txt</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ sort -n lengths.txt &gt; sorted-lengths.txt
$ head -n 1 sorted-lengths.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">  9  methane.pdb
</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>-n 1</code> with <code>head</code> tells it that we only want the first line of the file; <code>-n 20</code> would get the first 20, and so on.</p>
<p>Since <code>sorted-lengths.txt</code> contains the lengths of our files ordered from least to greatest, the output of <code>head</code> must be the file with the fewest lines.</p>
<h2 id="redirecting-to-the-same-file"><a class="header" href="#redirecting-to-the-same-file">Redirecting to the same file</a></h2>
<p>It's a very bad idea to try redirecting the output of a command that operates on a file to the same file. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ sort -n lengths.txt &gt; lengths.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Doing something like this may give you incorrect results and/or delete the contents of <code>lengths.txt</code>.</p>
<h2 id="what-does--mean"><a class="header" href="#what-does--mean">What Does <code>&gt;&gt;</code> Mean?</a></h2>
<p>We have seen the use of <code>&gt;</code>, but there is a similar operator <code>&gt;&gt;</code> which works slightly differently.  We'll learn about the differences between these two operators by printing some strings.</p>
<p>We can use the <code>echo</code> command to print strings e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ echo The echo command prints text
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">The echo command prints text
</code></pre>
<p>Now test the commands below to reveal the difference between the two operators:</p>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ echo hello &gt; testfile01.txt
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li></li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ echo hello &gt;&gt; testfile02.txt

<ol>
<li>In the first example with <code>&gt;</code>, the string 'hello' is written to <code>testfile01.txt</code>, but the file gets overwritten each time we run the command. 
&gt;&gt;</li>
<li>We see from the second example that the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> operator also writes 'hello' to a file (in this case<code>testfile02.txt</code>), but appends the string to the file if it already exists (i.e. when we run it for the second time).</li>

<p>We have already met the <code>head</code> command, which prints lines from the start of a file. <code>tail</code> is similar, but prints lines from the end of a file instead.</p>

After these commands, select the answer that corresponds to the file <code>animals-subset.csv</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Option 3 is <strong>correct.</strong>
&gt;&gt;</li>
<li>For option 1 to be correct we would only run the <code>head</code> command.
&gt;&gt;</li>
<li>For option 2 to be correct we would only run the <code>tail</code> command.
&gt;&gt;</li>
<li>For option 4 to be correct we would have to pipe the output of <code>head</code> into <code>tail -n 2</code> by doing <code>head -n 3 animals.csv | tail -n 2 &gt; animals-subset.csv</code></li>

<h2 id="passing-output-to-another-command"><a class="header" href="#passing-output-to-another-command">Passing output to another command</a></h2>
<p>In our example of finding the file with the fewest lines, we are using two intermediate files <code>lengths.txt</code> and <code>sorted-lengths.txt</code> to store output.</p>
<p>This is a confusing way to work because even once you understand what <code>wc</code>, <code>sort</code>, and <code>head</code> do, those intermediate files make it hard to follow what's going on. </p>
<p>We can make it easier to understand by running <code>sort</code> and <code>head</code> together:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ sort -n lengths.txt | head -n 1
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">  9  methane.pdb
</code></pre>
<p>The vertical bar, <code>|</code>, between the two commands is called a <strong>pipe</strong>. It tells the shell that we want to use the output of the command on the left as the input to the command on the right.</p>
<p>This has removed the need for the <code>sorted-lengths.txt</code> file.</p>
<h2 id="combining-multiple-commands"><a class="header" href="#combining-multiple-commands">Combining multiple commands</a></h2>
<p>Nothing prevents us from chaining pipes consecutively.</p>
<p>We can for example send the output of <code>wc</code> directly to <code>sort</code>, and then the resulting output to <code>head</code>.</p>
<p>This removes the need for any intermediate files.</p>
<p>We'll start by using a pipe to send the output of <code>wc</code> to <code>sort</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ wc -l *.pdb | sort -n
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">   9 methane.pdb
  12 ethane.pdb
  15 propane.pdb
  20 cubane.pdb
  21 pentane.pdb
  30 octane.pdb
 107 total
</code></pre>
<p>We can then send that output through another pipe, to <code>head</code>, so that the full pipeline becomes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ wc -l *.pdb | sort -n | head -n 1
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">   9  methane.pdb
</code></pre>
<p>This is exactly like a mathematician nesting functions like <em>log(3x)</em> and saying 'the log of three times <em>x</em>'. In our case, the calculation is 'head of sort of line count of <code>*.pdb</code>'.</p>
<p>The redirection and pipes used in the last few commands are illustrated below:</p>
<p><img src="Shell/fig/redirects-and-pipes.svg" alt="Redirects and Pipes of different commands: &quot;wc -l *.pdb&quot; will direct the output to the shell. &quot;wc -l *.pdb &gt; lengths&quot; will direct output to the file &quot;lengths&quot;. &quot;wc -l *.pdb | sort -n | head -n 1&quot; will build a pipeline where the output of the &quot;wc&quot; command is the input to the &quot;sort&quot; command, the output of the &quot;sort&quot; command is the input to the &quot;head&quot; command and the output of the &quot;head&quot; command is directed to the shell" /></p>

<p>This idea of linking programs together is why Unix has been so successful. Instead of creating enormous programs that try to do many different things, Unix programmers focus on creating lots of simple tools that each do one job well, and that work well with each other.</p>
<p>This programming model is called 'pipes and filters'. We've already seen pipes; a <strong>filter</strong> is a program like <code>wc</code> or <code>sort</code> that transforms a stream of input into a stream of output.</p>
<p>Almost all of the standard Unix tools can work this way: </p>
<ul>
<li>unless told to do otherwise,
<ul>
<li>they read from standard input,</li>
<li>do something with what they've read,</li>
<li>and write to standard output.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The key is that any program that reads lines of text from standard input and writes lines of text to standard output can be combined with every other program that behaves this way as well.</p>
<p>You can <em>and should</em> write your programs this way so that you and other people can put those programs into pipes to multiply their power.</p>

<li>This is correct answer

<li>The shell would expand <code>*</code> to match everything in the current directory, so the command would try to remove all matched files and an additional file called <code>.txt</code>

<p><strong>Loops</strong> are a programming construct which allow us to repeat a command or set of commands for each item in a list.</p>
<p>As such they are key to productivity improvements through automation. Similar to wildcards and tab completion, using loops also reduces the amount of typing required (and hence reduces the number of typing mistakes).</p>
<p>Suppose we have several hundred genome data files named <code>basilisk.dat</code>, <code>minotaur.dat</code>, and <code>unicorn.dat</code>.</p>
<p>For this example, we'll use the <code>exercise-data/creatures</code> directory which only has three example files, but the principles can be applied to many many more files at once.</p>
<p>The structure of these files is the same: the common name, classification, and updated date are presented on the first three lines, with DNA sequences on the following lines.</p>
<p>Let's look at the files:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ head -n 5 basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat
</code></pre>
<p>We would like to print out the classification for each species, which is given on the second line of each file.</p>
<p>For each file, we would need to execute the command <code>head -n 2</code> and pipe this to <code>tail -n 1</code>.</p>
<p>We’ll use a loop to solve this problem, but first let’s look at the general form of a loop:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">for thing in list_of_things
do
    operation_using $thing    # Indentation within the loop is not required, but aids legibility
done
</code></pre>
<p>... and we can apply this to our example like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ for filename in basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat
&gt; do
&gt;     head -n 2 $filename | tail -n 1
&gt; done
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">CLASSIFICATION: basiliscus vulgaris
CLASSIFICATION: bos hominus
CLASSIFICATION: equus monoceros
</code></pre>
<h2 id="follow-the-prompt"><a class="header" href="#follow-the-prompt">Follow the Prompt</a></h2>
<p>The shell prompt changes from <code>$</code> to <code>&gt;</code> and back again as we were typing in our loop. The second prompt, <code>&gt;</code>, is different to remind us that we haven't finished typing a complete command yet. A semicolon, <code>;</code>, can be used to separate two commands written on a single line.</p>
<p>When the shell sees the keyword <code>for</code>, it knows to repeat a command (or group of commands) once for each item in a list.</p>
<p>Each time the loop runs (called an iteration), an item in the list is assigned in sequence to the <strong>variable</strong>, and the commands inside the loop are executed, before moving on to the next item in the list.</p>
<p>Inside the loop, we call for the variable's value by putting <code>$</code> in front of it.</p>
<p>The <code>$</code> tells the shell interpreter to treat the variable as a variable name and substitute its value in its place, rather than treat it as text or an external command.</p>
<p>In this example, the list is three filenames: <code>basilisk.dat</code>, <code>minotaur.dat</code>, and <code>unicorn.dat</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Each time the loop iterates, it will assign a file name to the variable <code>filename</code> and run the <code>head</code> command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>. The first time through the loop, </code>$filename<code>is</code>basilisk.dat`.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The interpreter runs the command <code>head</code> on <code>basilisk.dat</code> and pipes the first two lines to the <code>tail</code> command, which then prints the second line of <code>basilisk.dat</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the second iteration, <code>$filename</code> becomes <code>minotaur.dat</code>. This time, the shell runs <code>head</code> on <code>minotaur.dat</code> and pipes the first two lines to the <code>tail</code> command, which then prints the second line of <code>minotaur.dat</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the third iteration, <code>$filename</code> becomes <code>unicorn.dat</code>, so the shell runs the <code>head</code> command on that file, and <code>tail</code> on the output of that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since the list was only three items, the shell exits the <code>for</code> loop.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="same-symbols-different-meanings"><a class="header" href="#same-symbols-different-meanings">Same Symbols, Different Meanings</a></h2>
<p>Here we see <code>&gt;</code> being used as a shell prompt, whereas <code>&gt;</code> is also used to redirect output.</p>
<p>Similarly, <code>$</code> is used as a shell prompt, but, as we saw earlier, it is also used to ask the shell to get the value of a variable. If the <em>shell</em> prints <code>&gt;</code> or <code>$</code> then it expects you to type something, and the symbol is a prompt.</p>
<p>If <em>you</em> type <code>&gt;</code> or <code>$</code> yourself, it is an instruction from you that the shell should redirect output or get the value of a variable.</p>
<p>When using variables it is also possible to put the names into curly braces to clearly delimit the variable name: <code>$filename</code> is equivalent to <code>${filename}</code>, but is different from <code>${file}name</code>. You may find this notation in other people's programs.</p>
<p>We have called the variable in this loop <code>filename</code> in order to make its purpose clearer to human readers.</p>
<p>The shell itself doesn't care what the variable is called; if we wrote this loop as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ for x in basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat
&gt; do
&gt;     head -n 2 $x | tail -n 1
&gt; done
</code></pre>
<p>or:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ for temperature in basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat
&gt; do
&gt;     head -n 2 $temperature | tail -n 1
&gt; done
</code></pre>
<p>...it would work exactly the same way. </p>
<p><em>Don't do this.</em></p>
<p>Programs are only useful if people can understand them, so meaningless names (like <code>x</code>) or misleading names (like <code>temperature</code>) increase the odds that the program won't do what its readers think it does.</p>
<p>In the above examples, the variables (<code>thing</code>, <code>filename</code>, <code>x</code> and <code>temperature</code>) could have been given any other name, as long as it is meaningful to both the person writing the code and the person reading it.</p>
<p>ote also that loops can be used for other things than filenames, like a list of numbers or a subset of data.</p>

<p>The first code block gives the same output on each iteration through the loop.
Bash expands the wildcard <code>*.pdb</code> within the loop body (as well as before the loop starts) to match all files ending in <code>.pdb</code> and then lists them using <code>ls</code>.</p>
<p>The expanded loop would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ for datafile in cubane.pdb  ethane.pdb  methane.pdb  octane.pdb  pentane.pdb  propane.pdb
&gt; do
&gt;     ls cubane.pdb  ethane.pdb  methane.pdb  octane.pdb  pentane.pdb  propane.pdb

<p>Let's continue with our example in the <code>shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/creatures</code> directory.</p>
<p>Here's a slightly more complicated loop:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ for filename in *.dat
&gt; do
&gt;     echo $filename
&gt;     head -n 100 $filename | tail -n 20
&gt; done
</code></pre>
<p>The shell starts by expanding <code>*.dat</code> to create the list of files it will process. </p>
<p>The <strong>loop body</strong> then executes two commands for each of those files.
The first command, <code>echo</code>, prints its command-line arguments to standard output.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ echo hello there
</code></pre>
<p>Outputs:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">hello there
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, since the shell expands <code>$filename</code> to be the name of a file, <code>echo $filename</code> prints the name of the file. </p>
<p>Note that we can't write this as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ for filename in *.dat
&gt; do
&gt;     $filename
&gt;     head -n 100 $filename | tail -n 20
&gt; done
</code></pre>
<p>...because then the first time through the loop, when <code>$filename</code> expanded to <code>basilisk.dat</code>, the shell would try to run <code>basilisk.dat</code> as a program.</p>
<p>Finally,the <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code> combination selects lines 81-100 from whatever file is being processed (assuming the file has at least 100 lines).</p>
<h2 id="spaces-in-names"><a class="header" href="#spaces-in-names">Spaces in Names</a></h2>
<p>Spaces are used to separate the elements of the list that we are going to loop over. If one of those elements contains a space character, we need to surround it with quotes, and do the same thing to our loop variable.
Suppose our data files are named:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">red dragon.dat
purple unicorn.dat
</code></pre>
<p>To loop over these files, we would need to add double quotes like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ for filename in &quot;red dragon.dat&quot; &quot;purple unicorn.dat&quot;
&gt; do
&gt;     head -n 100 &quot;$filename&quot; | tail -n 20
&gt; done
</code></pre>
<p>It is simpler to avoid using spaces (or other special characters) in filenames.</p>
<p>The files above don't exist, so if we run the above code, the <code>head</code> command will be unable to find them, however the error message returned will show the name of the files it is expecting:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">head: cannot open ‘red dragon.dat’ for reading: No such file or directory
head: cannot open ‘purple unicorn.dat’ for reading: No such file or directory
</code></pre>
<p>Try removing the quotes around <code>$filename</code> in the loop above to see the effect of the quote marks on spaces. Note that we get a result from the loop command for <code>unicorn.dat</code> when we run this code in the <code>creatures</code> directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">head: cannot open ‘red’ for reading: No such file or directory
head: cannot open ‘dragon.dat’ for reading: No such file or directory
head: cannot open ‘purple’ for reading: No such file or directory
CGGTACCGAA
AAGGGTCGCG
CAAGTGTTCC
...
</code></pre>
<p>We would like to modify each of the files in <code>shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/creatures</code>, but also save a version  of the original files, naming the copies <code>original-basilisk.dat</code> and <code>original-unicorn.dat</code>.
We can't use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cp *.dat original-*.dat
</code></pre>
<p>...because that would expand to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cp basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat original-*.dat
</code></pre>
<p>This wouldn't back up our files, instead we get an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cp: target `original-*.dat' is not a directory
</code></pre>
<p>This problem arises when <code>cp</code> receives more than two inputs. When this happens, it expects the last input to be a directory where it can copy all the files it was passed.</p>
<p>Since there is no directory named <code>original-*.dat</code> in the <code>creatures</code> directory we get an error.</p>
<p>Instead, we can use a loop:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ for filename in *.dat
&gt; do
&gt;     cp $filename original-$filename
&gt; done
</code></pre>
<p>This loop runs the <code>cp</code> command once for each filename.</p>
<p>The first time, when <code>$filename</code> expands to <code>basilisk.dat</code>,
the shell executes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cp basilisk.dat original-basilisk.dat
</code></pre>
<p>The second time, the command is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cp minotaur.dat original-minotaur.dat
</code></pre>
<p>The third and last time, the command is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cp unicorn.dat original-unicorn.dat
</code></pre>
<p>Since the <code>cp</code> command does not normally produce any output, it's hard to check that the loop is doing the correct thing.</p>
<p>However, we learned earlier how to print strings using <code>echo</code>, and we can modify the loop to use <code>echo</code> to print our commands without actually executing them.</p>
<p>As such we can check what commands <em>would be</em> run in the unmodified loop.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows what happens when the modified loop is executed, and demonstrates how the judicious use of <code>echo</code> is a good debugging technique.</p>
<p>The for loop:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">for filename in *.dat; 
do 
    echo cp $filename original-$filename;
done
</code></pre>
<p>... will successively assign the names of all <code>*.dat</code> files in your current directory to the variable <code>$filename</code> and then execute the command. With the files <code>basilisk.dat</code>, <code>minotaur.dat</code> and <code>unicorn.dat</code> in the current directory the loop will successively call the echo command three times and print three lines: </p>
<ol>
<li><code>cp basislisk.dat original-basilisk.dat</code></li>
<li><code>cp minotaur.dat</code> <code>original-minotaur.dat</code> </li>
<li><code>cp unicorn.dat' 'original-unicorn.dat</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Nelle is now ready to process her data files using <code>goostats.sh</code> --- a shell script written by her supervisor.</p>
<p>This calculates some statistics from a protein sample file, and takes two arguments:</p>
<ol>
<li>an input file (containing the raw data)</li>
<li>an output file (to store the calculated statistics)</li>
</ol>
<p>Since she's still learning how to use the shell, she decides to build up the required commands in stages.</p>
<p>Her first step is to make sure that she can select the right input files --- remember, these are ones whose names end in 'A' or 'B', rather than 'Z'.</p>
<p>Starting from her home directory, Nelle types:</p>

<p>Her next step is to decide what to call the files that the <code>goostats.sh</code> analysis program will create.</p>

<p>She hasn't actually run <code>goostats.sh</code> yet, but now she's sure she can select the right files and generate the right output filenames.</p>
<p>Typing in commands over and over again is becoming tedious, though,
and Nelle is worried about making mistakes, so instead of re-entering her loop, she presses <kbd>↑</kbd>.</p>
<p>In response, the shell redisplays the whole loop on one line (using semi-colons to separate the pieces):</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt; do echo $datafile stats-$datafile; done
</code></pre>
<p>Using the left arrow key, Nelle backs up and changes the command <code>echo</code> to <code>bash goostats.sh</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt; do bash goostats.sh $datafile stats-$datafile; done
</code></pre>
<p>When she presses <kbd>Enter</kbd>, the shell runs the modified command. </p>
<p>However, nothing appears to happen --- there is no output.</p>
<p>After a moment, Nelle realizes that since her script doesn't print anything to the screen any longer, she has no idea whether it is running, much less how quickly.</p>
<p>She kills the running command by typing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>, uses <kbd>↑</kbd> to repeat the command, and edits it to read:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt; do echo $datafile; bash goostats.sh $datafile stats-$datafile; done
</code></pre>
<h2 id="beginning-and-end"><a class="header" href="#beginning-and-end">Beginning and End</a></h2>
<p>We can move to the beginning of a line in the shell by typing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> and to the end using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd>.</p>
<p>When she runs her program now, it produces one line of output every five seconds or so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">NENE01729A.txt
NENE01729B.txt
NENE01736A.txt
...
</code></pre>
<p>1518 times 5 seconds, divided by 60, tells her that her script will take about two hours to run.</p>
<p>As a final check, she opens another terminal window, goes into <code>north-pacific-gyre</code>, and uses <code>cat stats-NENE01729B.txt</code> to examine one of the output files.</p>
<p>It looks good, so she decides to get some coffee and catch up on her reading.</p>
<h2 id="those-who-know-history-can-choose-to-repeat-it"><a class="header" href="#those-who-know-history-can-choose-to-repeat-it">Those Who Know History Can Choose to Repeat It</a></h2>
<p>Another way to repeat previous work is to use the <code>history</code> command to get a list of the last few hundred commands that have been executed, and then to use <code>!123</code> (where '123' is replaced by the command number) to repeat one of those commands. For example, if Nelle types this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ history | tail -n 5
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">456  ls -l NENE0*.txt
457  rm stats-NENE01729B.txt.txt
458  bash goostats.sh NENE01729B.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt
459  ls -l NENE0*.txt
460  history
</code></pre>
<p>...then she can re-run <code>goostats.sh</code> on <code>NENE01729B.txt</code> simply by typing <code>!458</code>.</p>
<h2 id="other-history-commands"><a class="header" href="#other-history-commands">Other History Commands</a></h2>
<p>There are a number of other shortcut commands for getting at the history. - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> enters a history search mode 'reverse-i-search' and finds the most recent command in your history that matches the text you enter next.</p>
<p>Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> one or more additional times to search for earlier matches.</p>
<p>You can then use the left and right arrow keys to choose that line and edit it then hit <kbd>Return</kbd> to run the command.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>!!</code> retrieves the immediately preceding command (you may or may not find this more convenient than using <kbd>↑</kbd>)
&gt;&gt;</li>
<li><code>!$</code> retrieves the last word of the last command.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's useful more often than you might expect: after <code>bash goostats.sh NENE01729B.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt</code>, you can type <code>less !$</code> to look at the file <code>stats-NENE01729B.txt</code>, which is quicker than doing <kbd>↑</kbd> and editing the command-line.</p>

<p>A loop is a way to do many things at once --- or to make many mistakes at once if it does the wrong thing. One way to check what a loop <em>would</em> do is to <code>echo</code> the commands it would run instead of actually running them.</p>
<p>Suppose we want to preview the commands the following loop will execute without actually running those commands:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ for datafile in *.pdb
&gt; do
&gt;     cat $datafile &gt;&gt; all.pdb
&gt; done

<p>What is the difference between the two loops below, and which one would we want to run?</p>

<li>The second version is the one we want to run.
<ul>
<li>This prints to screen everything enclosed in the quote marks, expanding the loop variable name because we have prefixed it with a dollar sign.</li>
<li>It also <em>does not</em> modify nor create the file <code>all.pdb</code>, as the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> is treated literally as part of a string rather than as a redirection instruction.

</ul>
</li>
<li>The first version appends the output from the command <code>echo cat $datafile</code> to the file, <code>all.pdb</code>.

<p>We have a nested loop, i.e. contained within another loop, so for each species in the outer loop, the inner loop (the nested loop) iterates over the list of temperatures, and creates a new directory for each combination.</p>

<p>We are finally ready to see what makes the shell such a powerful programming environment. We are going to take the commands we repeat frequently and save them in files so that we can re-run all those operations again later by typing a single command.</p>
<p>For historical reasons, a bunch of commands saved in a file is usually called a <strong>shell script</strong>, but make no mistake:</p>
<ul>
<li>these are actually small programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only will writing shell scripts make your work faster --- you won't have to retype the same commands over and over again --- it will also make it more accurate (fewer chances for typos) and more reproducible.</p>
<p>If you come back to your work later (or if someone else finds your work and wants to build on it) you will be able to reproduce the same results simply by running your script, rather than having to remember or retype a long list of commands.</p>
<p>Let's start by going back to <code>proteins/</code> and creating a new file, <code>middle.sh</code> which will become our shell script:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cd proteins
$ nano middle.sh
</code></pre>
<p>The command <code>nano middle.sh</code> opens the file <code>middle.sh</code> within the text editor 'nano' (which runs within the shell).</p>
<p>If the file does not exist, it will be created.</p>
<p>We can use the text editor to directly edit the file -- we'll simply insert the following line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">head -n 15 octane.pdb | tail -n 5
</code></pre>
<p>This is a variation on the pipe we constructed earlier: it selects lines 11-15 of the file <code>octane.pdb</code>.</p>
<p>Remember, we are <em>not</em> running it as a command just yet: </p>
<ul>
<li>we are putting the commands in a file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we save the file (<code>Ctrl-O</code> in nano), and exit the text editor (<code>Ctrl-X</code> in nano).</p>
<p>Check that the directory <code>proteins</code> now contains a file called <code>middle.sh</code>.</p>
<p>Once we have saved the file, we can ask the shell to execute the commands it contains.</p>
<p>Our shell is called <code>bash</code>, so we run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ bash middle.sh
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">ATOM      9  H           1      -4.502   0.681   0.785  1.00  0.00
ATOM     10  H           1      -5.254  -0.243  -0.537  1.00  0.00
ATOM     11  H           1      -4.357   1.252  -0.895  1.00  0.00
ATOM     12  H           1      -3.009  -0.741  -1.467  1.00  0.00
ATOM     13  H           1      -3.172  -1.337   0.206  1.00  0.00
</code></pre>
<p>Sure enough, our script's output is exactly what we would get if we ran that pipeline directly.</p>
<h2 id="text-vs-whatever"><a class="header" href="#text-vs-whatever">Text vs. Whatever</a></h2>
<p>We usually call programs like Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer &quot;text editors&quot;, but we need to be a bit more careful when it comes to programming. </p>
<p>By default, Microsoft Word uses <code>.docx</code> files to store not only text, but also formatting information about fonts, headings, and so on. This extra information isn't stored as characters and doesn't mean anything to tools like <code>head</code>: </p>
<ul>
<li>they expect input files to contain nothing but the letters, digits, and punctuation on a standard computer keyboard. When editing programs, therefore, you must either use a plain text editor, or be careful to save files as plain text.</li>
</ul>
<p>What if we want to select lines from an arbitrary file?
We could edit <code>middle.sh</code> each time to change the filename,
but that would probably take longer than typing the command out again
in the shell and executing it with a new file name.
Instead, let's edit <code>middle.sh</code> and make it more versatile:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ nano middle.sh
</code></pre>
<p>Now, within &quot;nano&quot;, replace the text <code>octane.pdb</code> with the special variable called <code>$1</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">head -n 15 &quot;$1&quot; | tail -n 5
</code></pre>
<p>Inside a shell script, <code>$1</code> means 'the first filename (or other argument) on the command line'.</p>
<p>We can now run our script like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ bash middle.sh octane.pdb
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">ATOM      9  H           1      -4.502   0.681   0.785  1.00  0.00
ATOM     10  H           1      -5.254  -0.243  -0.537  1.00  0.00
ATOM     11  H           1      -4.357   1.252  -0.895  1.00  0.00
ATOM     12  H           1      -3.009  -0.741  -1.467  1.00  0.00
ATOM     13  H           1      -3.172  -1.337   0.206  1.00  0.00
</code></pre>
<p>... or on a different file like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ bash middle.sh pentane.pdb
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">ATOM     9  H           1       1.324   0.350  -1.332  1.00  0.00

<h2 id="double-quotes-around-arguments"><a class="header" href="#double-quotes-around-arguments">Double-Quotes Around Arguments</a></h2>
<p>For the same reason that we put the loop variable inside double-quotes, in case the filename happens to contain any spaces, we surround <code>$1</code> with double-quotes.</p>
<p>Currently, we need to edit <code>middle.sh</code> each time we want to adjust the range of lines that is returned.</p>
<p>Let's fix that by configuring our script to instead use three command-line arguments.</p>
<p>After the first command-line argument (<code>$1</code>), each additional argument that we provide will be accessible via the special variables <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code>, <code>$3</code>,
which refer to the first, second, third command-line arguments, respectively.</p>
<p>Knowing this, we can use additional arguments to define the range of lines to be passed to <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code> respectively:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ nano middle.sh
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">head -n &quot;$2&quot; &quot;$1&quot; | tail -n &quot;$3&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>We can now run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ bash middle.sh pentane.pdb 15 5
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">ATOM      9  H           1       1.324   0.350  -1.332  1.00  0.00
ATOM     10  H           1       1.271   1.378   0.122  1.00  0.00
ATOM     11  H           1      -0.074  -0.384   1.288  1.00  0.00
ATOM     12  H           1      -0.048  -1.362  -0.205  1.00  0.00
ATOM     13  H           1      -1.183   0.500  -1.412  1.00  0.00
</code></pre>
<p>By changing the arguments to our command we can change our script's
behaviour:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ bash middle.sh pentane.pdb 20 5
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-sh">ATOM     14  H           1      -1.259   1.420   0.112  1.00  0.00
ATOM     15  H           1      -2.608  -0.407   1.130  1.00  0.00
ATOM     16  H           1      -2.540  -1.303  -0.404  1.00  0.00
ATOM     17  H           1      -3.393   0.254  -0.321  1.00  0.00
TER      18              1
</code></pre>
<p>This works, but it may take the next person who reads <code>middle.sh</code> a moment to figure out what it does.</p>
<p>We can improve our script by adding some <strong>comments</strong> at the top:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ nano middle.sh
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-sh"># Select lines from the middle of a file.
# Usage: bash middle.sh filename end_line num_lines
head -n &quot;$2&quot; &quot;$1&quot; | tail -n &quot;$3&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>A comment starts with a <code>#</code> character and runs to the end of the line.</p>
<p>The computer ignores comments, but they're invaluable for helping people (including your future self) understand and use scripts.</p>
<p>The only caveat is that each time you modify the script, you should check that the comment is still accurate:</p>
<p>an explanation that sends the reader in the wrong direction is worse than none at all.</p>
<p>What if we want to process many files in a single pipeline?</p>
<p>For example, if we want to sort our <code>.pdb</code> files by length, we would type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ wc -l *.pdb | sort -n
</code></pre>
<p>... because <code>wc -l</code> lists the number of lines in the files (recall that <code>wc</code> stands for 'word count', adding the <code>-l</code> option means 'count lines' instead)
and <code>sort -n</code> sorts things numerically.</p>
<p>We could put this in a file, but then it would only ever sort a list of <code>.pdb</code> files in the current directory.</p>
<p>If we want to be able to get a sorted list of other kinds of files, we need a way to get all those names into the script.</p>
<p>We can't use <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code>, and so on because we don't know how many files there are.</p>
<p>Instead, we use the special variable <code>$@</code>, which means, 'All of the command-line arguments to the shell script'.</p>
<p>We also should put <code>$@</code> inside double-quotes to handle the case of arguments containing spaces (<code>&quot;$@&quot;</code> is special syntax and is equivalent to <code>&quot;$1&quot;</code> <code>&quot;$2&quot;</code> ...).</p>
<p>Here's an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ nano sorted.sh
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-sh"># Sort files by their length.
# Usage: bash sorted.sh one_or_more_filenames
wc -l &quot;$@&quot; | sort -n
</code></pre>
<p>...</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ bash sorted.sh *.pdb ../creatures/*.dat
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">9   methane.pdb

<p>If a command causes something to crash or hang, it might be useful to know what that command was, in order to investigate the problem. Were the command only be recorded after running it, we would not have a record of the last command run in the event of a crash.</p>

<p>In practice, most people develop shell scripts by running commands at the shell prompt a few times to make sure they're doing the right thing,
then saving them in a file for re-use.</p>
<p>This style of work allows people to recycle what they discover about their data and their workflow with one call to <code>history</code> and a bit of editing to clean up the output and save it as a shell script.</p>
<h2 id="nelles-pipeline-creating-a-script"><a class="header" href="#nelles-pipeline-creating-a-script">Nelle's Pipeline: Creating a Script</a></h2>
<p>Nelle's supervisor insisted that all her analytics must be reproducible.</p>
<p>The easiest way to capture all the steps is in a script.</p>
<p>First we return to Nelle's project directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cd ../../north-pacific-gyre/
</code></pre>
<p>She creates a file using <code>nano</code> ...</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ nano do-stats.sh
</code></pre>
<p>...which contains the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh"># Calculate stats for data files.
for datafile in &quot;$@&quot;
do
    echo $datafile
    bash goostats.sh $datafile stats-$datafile
done
</code></pre>
<p>She saves this in a file called <code>do-stats.sh</code> so that she can now re-do the first stage of her analysis by typing:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ bash do-stats.sh NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt
</code></pre>
<p>She can also do this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ bash do-stats.sh NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt | wc -l
</code></pre>
<p>... so that the output is just the number of files processed rather than the names of the files that were processed.</p>
<p>One thing to note about Nelle's script is that it lets the person running it decide what files to process.</p>
<p>She could have written it as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh"># Calculate stats for Site A and Site B data files.
for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt
do
    echo $datafile
    bash goostats.sh $datafile stats-$datafile
done
</code></pre>
<p>The advantage is that this always selects the right files: </p>
<ul>
<li>she doesn't have to remember to exclude the 'Z' files.</li>
</ul>
<p>The disadvantage is that it <em>always</em> selects just those files --- she can't run it on all files (including the 'Z' files), or on the 'G' or 'H' files her colleagues in Antarctica are producing, without editing the script.</p>
<p>If she wanted to be more adventurous, she could modify her script to check for command-line arguments, and use <code>NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt</code> if none were provided.</p>
<p>Of course, this introduces another tradeoff between flexibility and complexity.</p>

<hr />
<p>In the same way that many of us now use 'Google' as a verb meaning 'to find', Unix programmers often use the word <code>grep</code>. </p>
<p><code>grep</code> is a contraction of 'global/regular expression/print', a common sequence of operations in early Unix text editors. </p>
<p>It is also the name of a very useful command-line program.</p>
<p><code>grep</code> finds and prints lines in files that match a pattern.</p>
<p>For our examples, we will use a file that contains three haiku taken from a 1998 competition in <em>Salon</em> magazine. For this set of examples, we're going to be working in the writing subdirectory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cd
$ cd Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/writing
$ cat haiku.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">The Tao that is seen
Is not the true Tao, until
You bring fresh toner.

With searching comes loss
and the presence of absence:
&quot;My Thesis&quot; not found.

Yesterday it worked
Today it is not working
Software is like that.
</code></pre>
<h2 id="forever-or-five-years"><a class="header" href="#forever-or-five-years">Forever, or Five Years</a></h2>
<p>We haven't linked to the original haiku because they don't appear to be on <em>Salon</em>'s site any longer.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.clir.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/ensuring.pdf">Jeff Rothenberg said</a>, 'Digital information lasts forever or five years, whichever comes first.' Luckily, popular content often <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?ComputerErrorHaiku">has backups</a>.</p>
<p>Let's find lines that contain the word 'not':</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ grep not haiku.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">Is not the true Tao, until
&quot;My Thesis&quot; not found
Today it is not working
</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>not</code> is the pattern we're searching for.</p>
<p>The grep command searches through the file, looking for matches to the pattern specified.</p>
<p>To use it type <code>grep</code>, then the pattern we're searching for and finally the name of the file (or files) we're searching in.</p>
<p>The output is the three lines in the file that contain the letters 'not'.</p>
<p>By default, grep searches for a pattern in a case-sensitive way.</p>
<p>In addition, the search pattern we have selected does not have to form a complete word, as we will see in the next example.</p>
<p>Let's search for the pattern: 'The'.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ grep The haiku.txt
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-sh">The Tao that is seen
&quot;My Thesis&quot; not found.
</code></pre>
<p>This time, two lines that include the letters <code>The</code> are outputted, one of which contained our search pattern within a larger word, <code>Thesis</code>.</p>
<p>To restrict matches to lines containing the word   <code>The</code> on its own, we can give <code>grep</code> with the <code>-w</code> option. This will limit matches to word boundaries.</p>
<p>Later in this lesson, we will also see how we can change the search behavior of <code>grep</code> with respect to its case sensitivity.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ grep -w The haiku.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">The Tao that is seen
</code></pre>
<p>Note that a 'word boundary' includes the start and end of a line, so not just letters surrounded by spaces. </p>
<p>Sometimes we don't want to search for a single word, but a phrase. This is also easy to do with <code>grep</code> by putting the phrase in quotes.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ grep -w &quot;is not&quot; haiku.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">Today it is not working
</code></pre>
<p>We've now seen that you don't have to have quotes around single words, but it is useful to use quotes when searching for multiple words.</p>
<p>It also helps to make it easier to distinguish between the search term or phrase and the file being searched.</p>
<p>We will use quotes in the remaining examples.</p>
<p>Another useful option is <code>-n</code>, which numbers the lines that match:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ grep -n &quot;it&quot; haiku.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">5:With searching comes loss
9:Yesterday it worked
10:Today it is not working
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we can see that lines 5, 9, and 10 contain the letters <code>it</code>.</p>
<p>We can combine options (i.e. flags) as we do with other Unix commands.</p>
<p>For example, let's find the lines that contain the word 'the'.</p>
<p>We can combine the option <code>-w</code> to find the lines that contain the word 'the' and <code>-n</code> to number the lines that match:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ grep -n -w &quot;the&quot; haiku.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">2:Is not the true Tao, until
6:and the presence of absence:
</code></pre>
<p>Now we want to use the option <code>-i</code> to make our search case-insensitive:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ grep -n -w -i &quot;the&quot; haiku.txt
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-sh">1:The Tao that is seen
2:Is not the true Tao, until
6:and the presence of absence:
</code></pre>
<p>Now, we want to use the option <code>-v</code> to invert our search, i.e., we want to output the lines that do not contain the word 'the'.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ grep -n -w -v &quot;the&quot; haiku.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">1:The Tao that is seen
3:You bring fresh toner.
4:
5:With searching comes loss
7:&quot;My Thesis&quot; not found.
8:
9:Yesterday it worked
10:Today it is not working
11:Software is like that.
</code></pre>
<p>If we use the <code>-r</code> (recursive) option, <code>grep</code> can search for a pattern recursively through a set of files in subdirectories.</p>
<p>Let's search recursively for <code>Yesterday</code> in the <code>shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/writing</code> directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ grep -r Yesterday .
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">./LittleWomen.txt:&quot;Yesterday, when Aunt was asleep and I was trying to be as still as a
./LittleWomen.txt:Yesterday at dinner, when an Austrian officer stared at us and then
./LittleWomen.txt:Yesterday was a quiet day spent in teaching, sewing, and writing in my

<p><code>grep</code> has lots of other options. To find out what they are, we can type:</p>

<p>Output:</p>

<h2 id="wildcards-1"><a class="header" href="#wildcards-1">Wildcards</a></h2>
<p><code>grep</code>'s real power doesn't come from its options, though; it comes from the fact that patterns can include wildcards. (The technical name for these is <strong>regular expressions</strong>, which is what the 're' in 'grep' stands for.) Regular expressions are both complex and powerful; As a taster, we can find lines that have an 'o' in the second position like this:</p>

<p>We use the <code>-E</code> option and put the pattern in quotes to prevent the shell from trying to interpret it. (If the pattern contained a <code>*</code>, for example, the shell would try to expand it before running <code>grep</code>). </p>
<p>The <code>^</code> in the pattern anchors the match to the start of the line. The <code>.</code> matches a single character (just like <code>?</code> in the shell), while the <code>o</code> matches an actual 'o'.</p>

<p>The <code>exercise-data</code> directory contains one file, <code>numbers.txt</code> and four directories: <code>animal-counts</code>, <code>creatures</code>, <code>proteins</code> and <code>writing</code> containing various files.</p>
<p>For our first command, let's run <code>find .</code> (remember to run this command from the <code>shell-lesson-data/exercise-data</code> folder).</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ find .
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">.

./writing/LittleWomen.txt
./writing/haiku.txt
./creatures

</code></pre>
<p>As always, the <code>.</code> on its own means the current working directory, which is where we want our search to start.</p>
<p><code>find</code>'s output is the names of every file <strong>and</strong> directory under the current working directory.</p>
<p>This can seem useless at first but <code>find</code> has many options to filter the output and in this lesson we will discover some of them.</p>
<p>The first option in our list is <code>-type d</code> that means 'things that are directories'.</p>
<p>Sure enough, <code>find</code>'s output is the names of the five directories (including <code>.</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ find . -type d
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">.
./writing
./creatures
./animal-counts
./proteins
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the objects <code>find</code> finds are not listed in any particular order. </p>
<p>If we change <code>-type d</code> to <code>-type f</code>, we get a listing of all the files instead:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ find . -type f
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-sh">./writing/LittleWomen.txt
./writing/haiku.txt
./creatures/basilisk.dat
./creatures/unicorn.dat
./creatures/minotaur.dat
./animal-counts/animals.csv
./numbers.txt
./proteins/ethane.pdb
./proteins/propane.pdb
./proteins/octane.pdb
./proteins/pentane.pdb
./proteins/methane.pdb
./proteins/cubane.pdb
</code></pre>
<p>Now let's try matching by name:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ find . -name *.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">./numbers.txt
</code></pre>
<p>We expected it to find all the text files, but it only prints out <code>./numbers.txt</code>.</p>
<p>The problem is that the shell expands wildcard characters like <code>*</code> <em>before</em> commands run. </p>
<p>Since <code>*.txt</code> in the current directory expands to <code>./numbers.txt</code>, the command we actually ran was:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ find . -name numbers.txt
</code></pre>
<p><code>find</code> did what we asked; we just asked for the wrong thing.</p>
<p>To get what we want, let's do what we did with <code>grep</code>:
put <code>*.txt</code> in quotes to prevent the shell from expanding the <code>*</code> wildcard.
This way, <code>find</code> actually gets the pattern <code>*.txt</code>, not the expanded filename <code>numbers.txt</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ find . -name &quot;*.txt&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">./writing/LittleWomen.txt
./writing/haiku.txt
./numbers.txt
</code></pre>
<h2 id="listing-vs-finding"><a class="header" href="#listing-vs-finding">Listing vs. Finding</a></h2>
<p><code>ls</code> and <code>find</code> can be made to do similar things given the right options, but under normal circumstances, <code>ls</code> lists everything it can, while <code>find</code> searches for things with certain properties and shows them.</p>
<p>As we said earlier, the command line's power lies in combining tools.
We've seen how to do that with pipes; let's look at another technique.
As we just saw, <code>find . -name &quot;*.txt&quot;</code> gives us a list of all text files in or below the current directory. </p>
<p>How can we combine that with <code>wc -l</code> to count the lines in all those files?</p>
<p>The simplest way is to put the <code>find</code> command inside <code>$()</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ wc -l $(find . -name &quot;*.txt&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">  21022 ./writing/LittleWomen.txt
     11 ./writing/haiku.txt
      5 ./numbers.txt
  21038 total
</code></pre>
<p>When the shell executes this command, the first thing it does is run whatever is inside the <code>$()</code>.</p>
<p>It then replaces the <code>$()</code> expression with that command's output. Since the output of <code>find</code> is the three filenames <code>./writing/LittleWomen.txt</code>, <code>./writing/haiku.txt</code>, and <code>./numbers.txt</code>, the shell constructs the command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sg">$ wc -l ./writing/LittleWomen.txt ./writing/haiku.txt ./numbers.txt
</code></pre>
<p>... which is what we wanted.</p>
<p>This expansion is exactly what the shell does when it expands wildcards like <code>*</code> and <code>?</code>, but lets us use any command we want as our own 'wildcard'.</p>
<p>It's very common to use <code>find</code> and <code>grep</code> together.</p>
<p>The first finds files that match a pattern; the second looks for lines inside those files that match another pattern.</p>
<p>Here, for example, we can find txt files that contain the word &quot;searching&quot; by looking for the string 'searching' in all the <code>.txt</code> files in the current directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ grep &quot;searching&quot; $(find . -name &quot;*.txt&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">./writing/LittleWomen.txt:sitting on the top step, affected to be searching for her book, but was
./writing/haiku.txt:With searching comes loss
</code></pre>
<h2 id="matching-and-subtracting"><a class="header" href="#matching-and-subtracting">Matching and Subtracting</a></h2>
<p>The <code>-v</code> option to <code>grep</code> inverts pattern matching, so that only lines which do <em>not</em> match the pattern are printed. Given that, which of the following commands will find all .dat files in <code>creatures</code> except <code>unicorn.dat</code>?</p>
<p>Once you have thought about your answer, you can test the commands in the <code>shell-lesson-data/exercise-data</code> directory.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>find creatures -name &quot;*.dat&quot; | grep -v unicorn</code></li>
<li><code>find creatures -name *.dat | grep -v unicorn</code></li>
<li><code>grep -v &quot;unicorn&quot; $(find creatures -name &quot;*.dat&quot;))</code></li>
<li>None of the above.</li>
</ol>

<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Option 1. is correct. Putting the match expression in quotes prevents the shell:
<ul>
<li>expanding it, so it gets passed to the <code>find</code> command.
&gt;&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Option 2 is also works in this instance because the shell tries to expand <code>*.dat</code> but there are no <code>*.dat</code> files in the current directory,  so the wildcard expression gets passed to <code>find</code>. 
<ul>
<li>We first encountered this in ![episode 3]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/03-create.md %}/#wildcards).
&gt;&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Option 3 is incorrect because it searches the contents of the files for lines which do not match 'unicorn', rather than searching the file names.</li>
</ul>

<p>We have focused exclusively on finding patterns in text files. What if your data is stored as images, in databases, or in some other format?</p>
<p>A handful of tools extend <code>grep</code> to handle a few non text formats. But a more generalizable approach is to convert the data to text, or extract the text-like elements from the data. On the one hand, it makes simple things easy to do. On the other hand, complex things are usually impossible. </p>
<p>For example, it's easy enough to write a program that will extract X and Y dimensions from image files for <code>grep</code> to play with, but how would you write something to find values in a spreadsheet whose cells contained formulas?</p>
<p>A last option is to recognize that the shell and text processing have their limits, and to use another programming language.</p>
<p>When the time comes to do this, don't be too hard on the shell: many modern programming languages have borrowed a lot of ideas from it, and imitation is also the sincerest form of praise.</p>
<p>The Unix shell is older than most of the people who use it. It has survived so long because it is one of the most productive programming environments ever created maybe even <em>the</em> most productive. </p>
<p>It's syntax may be cryptic, but people who have mastered it can experiment with different commands interactively, then use what they have learned to
automate their work.</p>
<p>Graphical user interfaces may be easier to use at first, but once learned, the productivity in the shell is unbeatable.</p>
<p>And as Alfred North Whitehead wrote in 1911, 'Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.'</p>

<tr><td>1. <a href="Shell/shell.html">Introducing the Shell</a></td><td>- A shell is a program whose primary purpose is to read commands and run other programs. <br><br>- This lesson uses Bash, the default shell in many implementations of Unix. <br><br> - Programs can be run in Bash by entering commands at the command-line prompt. <br><br> - The shell’s main advantages are its high action-to-keystroke ratio, its support for automating repetitive tasks, and its capacity to access networked machines. <br><br> - The shell’s main disadvantages are its primarily textual nature and how cryptic its commands and operation can be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2. <a href="Shell/fileDir.html">Navigating File and Directories</a></td><td>- The file system is responsible for managing information on the disk. <br><br> - Information is stored in files, which are stored in directories (folders). <br><br> - Directories can also store other directories, which then form a directory tree.<br><br> - <code>pwd</code> prints the user’s current working directory. <br><br> - <code>ls</code> [path] prints a listing of a specific file or directory; <code>ls</code> on its own lists the current working directory. <br><br> - <code>cd</code> [path] changes the current working directory.<br><br> - Most commands take options that begin with a single <code>-</code>.<br><br> - Directory names in a path are separated with <code>/</code> on Unix, but <code>\</code> on Windows. <br><br> - <code>/</code> on its own is the root directory of the whole file system. - <br><br> - An absolute path specifies a location from the root of the file system. <br><br> - A relative path specifies a location starting from the current location. <br><br> -  <code>.</code> on its own means ‘the current directory’; <code>..</code> means ‘the directory above the current one’.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3. <a href="Shell/create.html">Working with FIles and Directories</a></td><td>- <code>cp</code> [old] [new] copies a file. <br><br> - <code>mkdir</code> [path] creates a new directory. <br><br> - <code>mv</code> [old] [new] moves (renames) a file or directory. <br><br> - <code>rm</code> [path] removes (deletes) a file. <br><br> - <code>*</code> matches zero or more characters in a filename, so <code>*</code>.txt matches all files ending in <code>.txt</code>. - <code>?</code> matches any single character in a filename, so <code>?.txt</code> matches <code>a.txt</code> but not <code>any.txt</code>. <br><br> - Use of the Control key may be described in many ways, including <kbd>Ctrl-X</kbd>, <kbd>Control-X</kbd>, and <kbd>^X</kbd>. <br><br> - The shell does not have a trash bin: once something is deleted, it’s really gone.<br><br> - Most files’ names are <code>something.extension</code>. The extension isn’t required, and doesn’t guarantee anything, but is normally used to indicate the type of data in the file. <br><br> - Depending on the type of work you do, you may need a more powerful text editor than Nano.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4. <a href="Shell/pipefilter.html">Pipes and Filter</a></td><td>- <code>wc</code> counts lines, words, and characters in its inputs. <br><br> - <code>cat</code> displays the contents of its inputs. <br><br> - <code>sort</code> sorts its inputs. <br><br> - <code>head</code> displays the first 10 lines of its input. <br><br> - <code>tail</code> displays the last 10 lines of its input. <br><br> - command <code>&gt;</code> [file] redirects a command’s output to a file (overwriting any existing content). <br><br> - <code>command &gt;&gt; [file]</code> appends a command’s output to a file. <br><br> - `[first]</td></tr>
<tr><td>5. <a href="Shell/loops.html">Loops</a></td><td>- A for loop repeats commands once for every thing in a list. <br><br> - Every for loop needs a variable to refer to the thing it is currently operating on. <br><br> - Use <code>$name</code> to expand a variable (i.e., get its value). <code>${name}</code> can also be used. <br><br> - Do not use spaces, quotes, or wildcard characters such as <code>*</code> or <code>?</code> in filenames, as it complicates variable expansion. <br><br> - Give files consistent names that are easy to match with wildcard patterns to make it easy to select them for looping. <br><br> - Use the up-arrow key to scroll up through previous commands to edit and repeat them. <br><br> - Use <kbd>Ctrl+R</kbd> to search through the previously entered commands. <br><br> - Use <code>history</code> to display recent commands, and <code>![number]</code> to repeat a command by number.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6. <a href="Shell/scripts.html">Scripts</a></td><td>- Save commands in files (usually called shell scripts) for re-use. <br><br> - <code>bash [filename]</code> runs the commands saved in a file. <br><br> - <code>$@</code> refers to all of a shell script’s command-line arguments. <br><br> - <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code>, etc., refer to the first command-line argument, the second command-line argument, etc. <br><br> - Place variables in quotes if the values might have spaces in them. <br><br> - Letting users decide what files to process is more flexible and more consistent with built-in Unix commands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7. <a href="Shell/find.html">Finding Things</a></td><td>- <code>find</code> finds files with specific properties that match patterns. <br><br> - <code>grep</code> selects lines in files that match patterns. <br><br> - <code>--help</code> is an option supported by many bash commands, and programs that can be run from within Bash, to display more information on how to use these commands or programs.<br><br> - <code>man [command]</code> displays the manual page for a given command. <br><br> - <code>$([command])</code> inserts a command’s output in place.</td></tr>

<ul>
<li>A path that refers to a particular location in a file system. Absolute paths are usually written with respect to the file system’s root directory, and begin with either “/” (on Unix) or “\” (on Microsoft Windows). See also: relative path.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="argument"><a class="header" href="#argument">argument</a></h4>

<ul>
<li>A remark in a program that is intended to help human readers understand what is going on, but is ignored by the computer. Comments in Python, R, and the Unix shell start with a <code>#</code> character and run to the end of the line; comments in SQL start with <code>--</code>, and other languages have other conventions.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="current-working-directory"><a class="header" href="#current-working-directory">current working directory</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The directory that relative paths are calculated from; equivalently, the place where files referenced by name only are searched for. Every process has a current working directory. The current working directory is usually referred to using the shorthand notation <code>.</code> (pronounced “dot”).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="file-system"><a class="header" href="#file-system">file system</a></h4>
<ul>

<h4 id="filename-extension"><a class="header" href="#filename-extension">filename extension</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The portion of a file’s name that comes after the final <code>“.”</code> character. By convention this identifies the file’s type: <code>.txt</code> means “text file”, <code>.png</code> means “Portable Network Graphics file”, and so on. These conventions are not enforced by most operating systems: it is perfectly possible (but confusing!) to name an MP3 sound file homepage.html. Since many applications use filename extensions to identify the <a href="Shell/reference.html#mime-type">MIME</a> type of the file, misnaming files may cause those applications to fail.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="filter"><a class="header" href="#filter">filter</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>A program that transforms a stream of data. Many Unix command-line tools are written as filters: they read data from <a href="Shell/reference.html#standard-input">standard input</a>, process it, and write the result to <a href="Shell/reference.html#standard-output">standard output</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="for-loop"><a class="header" href="#for-loop">for loop</a></h4>

</ul>
<h4 id="loop"><a class="header" href="#loop">loop</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>A set of instructions to be executed multiple times. Consists of a loop body and (usually) a condition for exiting the loop. See also for <a href="Shell/reference.html#loop">loop</a> and <a href="Shell/reference.html#while-loop">while loop</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="loop-body"><a class="header" href="#loop-body">loop body</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The set of statements or commands that are repeated inside a for <a href="Shell/reference.html#loop">loop</a> or <a href="Shell/reference.html#while-loop">while loop</a>.</li>

<h4 id="option"><a class="header" href="#option">option</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>A way to specify an argument or setting to a command-line program. By convention Unix applications use a dash followed by a single letter, such as -v, or two dashes followed by a word, such as <code>--verbose</code>, while DOS applications use a slash, such as <code>/V</code>. Depending on the application, an option may be followed by a single argument, as in <code>-o /tmp/output.txt</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="parameter"><a class="header" href="#parameter">parameter</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>A variable named in a function’s declaration that is used to hold a value passed into the call. The term is often used interchangeably (and inconsistently) with argument.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="parent-directory"><a class="header" href="#parent-directory">parent directory</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The directory that “contains” the one in question. Every directory in a file system except the root directory has a parent. A directory’s parent is usually referred to using the shorthand notation <code>..</code> (pronounced “dot dot”).</li>

<ul>
<li>A running instance of a program, containing code, variable values, open files and network connections, and so on. Processes are the “actors” that the operating system manages; it typically runs each process for a few milliseconds at a time to give the impression that they are executing simultaneously.</li>

<h4 id="prompt"><a class="header" href="#prompt">prompt</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>A character or characters display by a <a href="Shell/reference.html#read-evaluate-print-loop">REPL</a> to show that it is waiting for its next command.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="quoting"><a class="header" href="#quoting">quoting</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>(in the shell): Using quotation marks of various kinds to prevent the shell from interpreting special characters. For example, to pass the string <code>*.txt</code> to a program, it is usually necessary to write it as <code>'*.txt'</code> (with single quotes) so that the shell will not try to expand the <code>*</code> wildcard.</li>

<p>We can get help for any Unix command with the <code>man</code> (short for manual) command.</p>
<p>For example, here is the command to look up information on <code>cp</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ man cp
</code></pre>
<p>The output displayed is referred to as the &quot;man page&quot;.</p>
<p>The man page will be displayed in the default file viewer for our shell, which usually a program called <code>more</code>. When <code>more</code> displays a colon ':', we can press the space bar to get the next page, the letter 'h' to get help or the letter 'q' to quit.</p>
<p><code>man</code>'s output is typically complete but concise, as it is designed to be used as a reference rather than a tutorial.</p>
<p>Most man pages are divided into sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NAME</strong>:
gives the name of the command and a brief description</li>
<li><strong>SYNOPSIS</strong>:
how to run the command, including optional and mandatory parameters.    (We will explain the syntax later.)</li>
<li><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>:
a fuller description than the synopsis, including a description of all the options to the command. This section may also include example usage or details about how the command works.</li>
<li><strong>EXAMPLES</strong>:
self-explanatory.</li>
<li><strong>SEE ALSO</strong>:
list other commands that we might find useful or other sources of information that might help us.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other sections we might see include:
<strong>AUTHOR</strong>, <strong>REPORTING BUGS</strong>, <strong>COPYRIGHT</strong>, <strong>HISTORY</strong>, <strong>(known) BUGS</strong>, and <strong>COMPATIBILITY</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-read-the-synopsis"><a class="header" href="#how-to-read-the-synopsis">How to Read the Synopsis</a></h2>
<p>Here is the is synopsis for the <code>cp</code> command on Ubuntu Linux:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">SYNOPSIS
   cp [OPTION]... [-T] SOURCE DEST
   cp [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY
   cp [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY SOURCE...
</code></pre>
<p>This tells the reader that there are three ways to use the command.</p>
<p>Let's look at the first usage:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cp [OPTION]... [-T] SOURCE DEST
</code></pre>
<p><code>[OPTION]</code> means the <code>cp</code> command can be followed by one or more optional [flags]({{ page.root }}/reference/{{ site.index }}#command).</p>
<p>We can tell they're optional because of the square brackets, and we can tell that one or more are welcome because of the ellipsis (...).</p>
<p>For example, the fact that <code>[-T]</code> is in square brackets, but after the ellipsis, means that it's optional, but if it's used, it must come after all the other options.</p>
<p><code>SOURCE</code> refers to the source file or directory, and <code>DEST</code> to the destination file or directory.</p>
<p>Their precise meanings are explained at the top of the <code>DESCRIPTION</code> section.</p>
<p>The other two usage examples can be read in similar ways.</p>
<p>Note that to use the last one, the <code>-t</code> option is mandatory (because it isn't shown in square brackets).</p>
<p>The <code>DESCRIPTION</code> section starts with a few paragraphs explaining the command and its use, then expands on the possible options one by one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">     The following options are available:

-a    Same as -pPR options. Preserves structure and attributes of
           files but not directory structure.

     -f    If the destination file cannot be opened, remove it and create
           a new file, without prompting for confirmation regardless of
           its permissions.  (The -f option overrides any previous -n
           option.)

           The target file is not unlinked before the copy.  Thus, any
           existing access rights will be retained.

      ...  ...
</code></pre>
<h2 id="finding-help-on-specific-options"><a class="header" href="#finding-help-on-specific-options">Finding Help on Specific Options</a></h2>
<p>If we want to skip ahead to the option you're interested in, we can search for it using the slash key '/'.</p>
<p>(This isn't part of the <code>man</code> command: it's a feature of <code>more</code>.)</p>
<p>For example, to find out about <code>-t</code>, we can type <code>/-t</code> and press return. After that, we can use the 'n' key to navigate to the next match until we find the detailed information we need:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">-t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY
     copy all SOURCE arguments into DIRECTORY
</code></pre>
<p>This means that this option has the short form <code>-t</code> and the long form <code>--target-directory</code> and that it takes an argument.</p>
<p>Its meaning is to copy all the SOURCE arguments into DIRECTORY. Thus, we can give the destination explicitly instead of relying on having to place the directory at the end.</p>
<h2 id="limitations-of-man-pages"><a class="header" href="#limitations-of-man-pages">Limitations of Man Pages</a></h2>
<p>Man pages can be useful for a quick confirmation of how to run a command, but they are not famous for being readable. If you can't find what you need in the man page; or you can't understand what you've found; try entering &quot;unix command copy file&quot; into your favorite search engine: it will often produce more helpful results.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://explainshell.com/">explainshell.com</a> site does a great job of breaking complex Unix commands into parts and explaining what each does.

<hr />
<p>Let's take a closer look at what happens when we use the shell on a desktop or laptop computer.</p>
<p>The first step is to log in so that the operating system knows who we are and what we're allowed to do.</p>
<p>We do this by typing our username and password; the operating system checks those values against its records, and if they match, runs a shell for us.</p>
<p>As we type commands, the 1's and 0's that represent the characters we're typing are sent from the keyboard to the shell.</p>
<p>The shell displays those characters on the screen to represent what we type,
and then, if what we typed was a command, the shell executes it and displays its output (if any).</p>
<p>What if we want to run some commands on another machine, such as the server in the basement that manages our database of experimental results?</p>
<p>To do this, we have to first log in to that machine.</p>
<p>We call this a <a href="Shell_Extras/%7B./references.html#remote-login">remote login</a>.</p>
<p>In order for us to be able to login, the remote computer must be running  a <a href="Shell_Extras/./references.html#remote-login-server">remote login server</a> and we will run a client program that can talk to that server.</p>
<p>The client program passes our login credentials to the remote login server and, if we are allowed to login, that server then runs a shell for us on the  remote computer.</p>
<p>Once our local client is connected to the remote server, everything we type into the client is passed on, by the server, to the shell running on the remote computer.</p>
<p>That remote shell runs those commands on our behalf, just as a local shell would, then sends back output, via the server, to our client, for our computer to display.</p>
<h2 id="ssh-history"><a class="header" href="#ssh-history">SSH History</a></h2>
<p>Back in the day, when everyone trusted each other and knew every chip in their computer by its first name, people didn't encrypt anything except the most sensitive information when sending it over a network and the two programs used for running a shell (usually back then, the Bourne Shell, <code>sh</code>) on, or copying files to, a remote machine were named <code>rsh</code> and <code>rcp</code>, respectively. Think (<code>r</code>)emote <code>sh</code> and <code>cp</code></p>
<p>However, anyone could watch the unencrypted network traffic, which meant that villains could steal usernames and passwords, and use them for all manner of nefarious purposes.</p>
<p>The <a href="Shell_Extras/%7B./references.html#ssh-protocol">SSH protocol</a> was invented to prevent this (or at least slow it down).</p>
<p>It uses several sophisticated, and heavily tested, encryption protocols to ensure that outsiders can't see what's in the messages going back and forth between different computers.</p>
<p>The remote login server which accepts connections from client programs is known as the <a href="Shell_Extras/./referencesm.html#ssh-daemon">SSH daemon</a>, or <code>sshd</code>.</p>
<p>The client program we use to login remotely is the <a href="Shell_Extras/./references.html#secure-shell">secure shell</a>, or <code>ssh</code>, think (<code>s</code>)ecure <code>sh</code>. </p>
<p>The <code>ssh</code> login client has a companion program called <code>scp</code>, think  (<code>s</code>)ecure <code>cp</code>,  which allows us to copy files to or from a remote computer using the same kind of encrypted connection.</p>
<h2 id="a-remote-login-using-ssh"><a class="header" href="#a-remote-login-using-ssh">A remote login using <code>ssh</code></a></h2>
<p>To make a remote login, we issue the command <code>ssh username@computer</code>  which tries to make a connection to the SSH daemon running on the remote computer we have specified.</p>
<p>After we log in, we can use the remote shell to use the remote computer's files and directories.</p>
<p>Typing <code>exit</code> or <kbd>CTRL+D</kbd> terminates the remote shell, and the local client program, and returns us to our previous shell.</p>
<p>In the example below, the remote machine's command prompt is <code>moon&gt;</code>
instead of just <code>$</code>.</p>
<p>To make it clearer which machine is doing what, we'll indent the commands sent to the remote machine and their output.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ pwd
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">/users/vlad

<h2 id="copying-files-to-and-from-a-remote-machine-using-scp"><a class="header" href="#copying-files-to-and-from-a-remote-machine-using-scp">Copying files to, and from a remote machine using <code>scp</code></a></h2>
<p>To copy a file, we specify the source and destination paths,
either of which may include computer names.</p>
<p>If we leave out a computer name, <code>scp</code> assumes we mean the machine we're running on.</p>
<p>For example, this command copies our latest results to the backup server in the basement,
printing out its progress as it does so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ scp results.dat vlad@backupserver:backups/results-2011-11-11.dat
Password: ********
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">results.dat              100%  9  1.0 MB/s 00:00
</code></pre>
<p>Note the colon <code>:</code>, seperating the hostname of the server and the pathname of  the file we are copying to.</p>
<p>It is this character that informs <code>scp</code> that the source or target of the copy is on the remote machine and the reason it is needed can be explained as follows:</p>
<p>In the same way that the default directory into which we are placed when running a shell on a remote machine is our home directory on that machine, the default target, for a remote copy, is also the  home directory.</p>
<p>This means that...</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ scp results.dat vlad@backupserver:
</code></pre>
<p>... would copy <code>results.dat</code> into our home directory on <code>backupserver</code>, however, if we did not have the colon to inform <code>scp</code> of the remote machine, we would still have a valid commmad...</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ scp results.dat vlad@backupserver
</code></pre>
<p>...but now we have merely created a file called <code>vlad@backupserver</code> on our local machine, as we would have done with <code>cp</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cp results.dat vlad@backupserver
</code></pre>
<p>Copying a whole directory betwen remote machines uses the same syntax as the <code>cp</code> command:</p>
<p>We just use the <code>-r</code> option to signal that we want copying to be recursively.</p>
<p>For example, this command copies all of our results from the backup server to our laptop:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ scp -r vlad@backupserver:backups ./backups
Password: ********
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">results-2011-09-18.dat              100%  7  1.0 MB/s 00:00
results-2011-10-04.dat              100%  9  1.0 MB/s 00:00

<h2 id="running-commands-on-a-remote-machine-using-ssh"><a class="header" href="#running-commands-on-a-remote-machine-using-ssh">Running commands on a remote machine using <code>ssh</code></a></h2>
<p>Here's one more thing the <code>ssh</code> client program can do for us.</p>
<p>Suppose we want to check whether we have already created the file <code>backups/results-2011-11-12.dat</code> on the backup server.</p>
<p>Instead of logging in and then typing <code>ls</code>, we could do this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ssh vlad@backupserver &quot;ls results*&quot;
Password: ********
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">results-2011-09-18.dat  results-2011-10-28.dat
results-2011-10-04.dat  results-2011-11-11.dat
</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>ssh</code> takes the argument after our remote username and passes them to the shell on the remote computer.</p>
<p>(We have to put quotes around it to make it look like a single argument.)</p>
<p>Since those arguments are a legal command, the remote shell runs <code>ls results</code> for us and sends the output back to our local shell for display.</p>
<h2 id="ssh-keys"><a class="header" href="#ssh-keys">SSH Keys</a></h2>
<p>Typing our password over and over again is annoying, especially if the commands we want to run remotely are in a loop.</p>
<p>To remove the need to do this, we can create an [SSH key]({{ page.root }}/reference/{{ site.index }}#ssh-key) to tell the remote machine that it should always trust us.</p>
<p>SSH keys come in pairs, a public key that gets shared with services like GitHub, and a private key that is stored only on your computer. If the keys match, you're granted access.</p>
<p>The cryptography behind SSH keys ensures that no one can reverse engineer your private key from the public one.</p>
<p>The first step in using SSH authorization is to generate your own key pair.</p>
<p>You might already have an SSH key pair on your machine. You can check to see if one exists by moving to your <code>.ssh</code> directory and listing the contents.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cd ~/.ssh
$ ls
</code></pre>
<p>If you see <code>id_rsa.pub</code>, you already have a key pair and don't need to create a new one.</p>
<p>If you don't see <code>id_rsa.pub</code>, use the following command to generate a new key pair. </p>
<p>Make sure to replace <code>your@email.com</code> with your own email address.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C &quot;your@email.com&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>When asked where to save the new key, hit enter to accept the default location.</p>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa):
</code></pre>
<p>You will then be asked to provide an optional passphrase. This can be used to make your key even more secure, but if what you want is avoiding type your password every time you can skip it by hitting enter twice.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
</code></pre>
<p>When the key generation is complete, you should see the following confirmation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">Your identification has been saved in /Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
01:0f:f4:3b:ca:85:d6:17:a1:7d:f0:68:9d:f0:a2:db your@email.com
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 2048]----+
|                 |
|                 |
|        . E +    |
|       . o = .   |
|      . S =   o  |
|       o.O . o   |
|       o .+ .    |
|      . o+..     |
|       .+=o      |
+-----------------+
</code></pre>
<p>The random art image is an alternate way to match keys but we won't be needing this.</p>
<p>Now you need to place a copy of your public key ony any servers you would like to use SSH to connect to, instead of logging in with a username and <code>passwd</code>.</p>
<p>Display the contents of your new public key file with <code>cat</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>

<p>After append the content, logout of the remote machine and try login again. If you setup your SSH key correctly you won't need to type your password.</p>

<h2 id="ssh-files-and-directories"><a class="header" href="#ssh-files-and-directories">SSH Files and Directories</a></h2>
<p>The example of copying our public key to a remote machine, so that it  can then be used when we next SSH into that remote machine, assumed that we already had a directory <code>~/.ssh/</code>.</p>
<p>Whilst a remote server may support the use of SSH to login, your home directory there may not contain a <code>.ssh</code> directory by default.</p>
<p>We have already seen that we can use SSH to run commands on remote machines, so we can ensure that everything is set up as required before we place the copy of our public key on a remote machine.</p>
<p>Walking through this process allows us to highlight some of the typical  requirements of the SSH protocol itself, as documented in the man-page for the <code>ssh</code> command.</p>
<p>Firstly, we check that we have a <code>.ssh/</code> directory on another remote machine, <code>comet</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ssh vlad@comet &quot;ls -ld ~/.ssh&quot;

<p>Oh dear! We should create the directory; and check that it's there (Note: two commands, seperated by a semicolon) :</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ssh vlad@comet &quot;mkdir ~/.ssh; ls -ld ~/.ssh&quot;
Password: ********
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">    drwxr-xr-x 2 vlad vlad 512 Jan 01 09:09 /home/vlad/.ssh
</code></pre>
<p>Now we have a dot-SSH directory, into which to place SSH-related files but we can see that the default permissions allow anyone to inspect the files within that directory.</p>
<p>For a protocol that is supposed to be secure, this is not considered a good thing and so the recommended permissions are read/write/execute for the user, and not accessible by others.</p>
<p>Let's alter the permissions on the directory</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ssh vlad@comet &quot;chmod 700 ~/.ssh; ls -ld ~/.ssh&quot;
Password: ********
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">    drwx------ 2 vlad vlad 512 Jan 01 09:09 /home/vlad/.ssh
</code></pre>
<p>That's looks much better.</p>
<p>In the above example, it was suggested that we paste the content of our public key at the end of <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>, however as we didn't have a <code>~/.ssh/</code> on this remote machine, we can simply copy our public key over as the initial <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>, and of course, we will use <code>scp</code> to do this, even though we don't yet have passwordless SSH access set up.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub vlad@comet:.ssh/authorized_keys
Password: ********
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the default target for the <code>scp</code> command on a remote machine is the home directory, so we have not needed to use the shorthand <code>~/.ssh/</code> or even the full path <code>/home/vlad/.ssh/</code> to  our home directory there.</p>
<p>Checking the permissions of the file we have just created on the remote machine, also serves to indicate that we no longer need to use our password, because we now have what's needed to use SSH without it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ssh vlad@comet &quot;ls -l ~/.ssh&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">    -rw-r--r-- 2 vlad vlad 512 Jan 01 09:11 /home/vlad/.ssh/authorized_keys
</code></pre>
<p>Whilst the authorized keys file is not considered to be highly sensitive,  (after all, it contains public keys), we alter the permissions to match the man page's recommendations :</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ssh vlad@comet &quot;chmod go-r ~/.ssh/authorized_keys; ls -l ~/.ssh&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">    -rw------- 2 vlad vlad 512 Jan 01 09:11 /home/vlad/.ssh/authorized_keys

<hr />
<p>Unix controls who can read, modify, and run files using <em>permissions</em>. We'll discuss how Windows handles permissions at the end of the section:</p>
<ul>
<li>the concepts are similar, but the rules are different.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's start with Nelle.</p>
<p>She has a unique <a href="Shell_Extras/./references.html#user-name">user name</a>, <code>nnemo</code>, and a <a href="Shell_Extras/./references.html#user-id">user ID</a>, 1404.</p>
<h2 id="why-integer-ids"><a class="header" href="#why-integer-ids">Why Integer IDs?</a></h2>
<p>Why integers for IDs? </p>
<p>Again, the answer goes back to the early 1970s. Character strings like <code>alan.turing</code> are of varying length,  and comparing one to another takes many instructions.</p>
<p>Integers, on the other hand, use a fairly small amount of storage (typically four characters), and can be compared with a single instruction.</p>
<p>To make operations fast and simple, programmers often keep track of things internally using integers, then use a lookup table of some kind to translate those integers into user-friendly text for presentation.</p>
<p>Of course, programmers being programmers, they will often skip the user-friendly string part and just use the integers, in the same way that someone working in a lab might talk about Experiment 28 instead of &quot;the chronotypical alpha-response trials on anacondas&quot;.</p>
<p>Users can belong to any number of <a href="Shell_Extras/./references.html#user-group">groups</a>, each of which has a unique <a href="Shell_Extras/./references.html#user-group-name">group name</a> and numeric <a href="Shell_Extras/./references.html#user-group-id">group ID</a>.</p>
<p>The list of who's in what group is usually stored in the file <code>/etc/group</code>. (If you're in front of a Unix machine right now, try running <code>cat /etc/group</code> to look at that file.)</p>
<p>Now let's look at files and directories.</p>
<p>Every file and directory on a Unix computer belongs to one owner and one group.</p>
<p>Along with each file's content, the operating system stores the numeric IDs of the user and group that own it.</p>
<p>The user-and-group model means that for each file every user on the system falls into one of three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>the owner of the file, (u)</li>
<li>someone in the file's group, (g)</li>
<li>and everyone else. (r)</li>
</ul>
<p>For each of these three categories, the computer keeps track of whether people in that category can read the file, write to the file, or execute the file
(i.e., run it if it is a program).</p>
<p>For example, if a file had the following set of permissions:</p>
<table class="table table-striped">
<tr><td></td><th>user</th><th>group</th><th>all</th></tr>
<tr><th>read</th><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>no</td></tr>
<tr><th>write</th><td>yes</td><td>no</td><td>no</td></tr>
<tr><th>execute</th><td>no</td><td>no</td><td>no</td></tr>
</table>
<p>it would mean that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the file's owner can read and write it, but not run it;</li>
<li>other people in the file's group can read it, but not modify it or run it; and</li>
<li>everybody else can do nothing with it at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's look at this model in action.</p>
<p>If we <code>cd</code> into the <code>labs</code> directory and run <code>ls -F</code>, it puts a <code>*</code> at the end of <code>setup</code>'s name.</p>
<p>This is its way of telling us that <code>setup</code> is executable,
i.e., that it's (probably) something the computer can run.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cd labs
$ ls -F
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">safety.txt    setup*     waiver.txt
</code></pre>
<h2 id="necessary-but-not-sufficient"><a class="header" href="#necessary-but-not-sufficient">Necessary But Not Sufficient</a></h2>
<p>The fact that something is marked as executable doesn't actually mean it contains a program of some kind.</p>
<p>We could easily mark this HTML file as executable using the commands that are introduced below.</p>
<p>Depending on the operating system we're using, trying to &quot;run&quot; it will either fail (because it doesn't contain instructions the computer recognizes) or cause the operating system to open the file with whatever application usually handles it (such as a web browser).</p>
<p>Now let's run the command <code>ls -l</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls -l
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">-rw-rw-r-- 1 vlad bio  1158  2010-07-11 08:22 safety.txt
-rwxr-xr-x 1 vlad bio 31988  2010-07-23 20:04 setup
-rw-rw-r-- 1 vlad bio  2312  2010-07-11 08:23 waiver.txt
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-l</code> flag tells <code>ls</code> to give us a long-form listing.</p>
<p>It's a lot of information, so let's go through the columns in turn.</p>
<p>On the right side, we have the files'  names.</p>
<p>Next to them, moving left, are the times and dates they were last modified.</p>
<p>Backup systems and other tools use this information in a variety of ways, but you can use it to tell when you (or anyone else with permission) last changed a file.</p>
<p>Next to the modification time is the file's size in bytes and the names of the user and group that owns it (in this case, <code>vlad</code> and <code>bio</code> respectively).</p>
<p>We'll skip over the second column for now (the one showing <code>1</code> for each file) because it's the first column that we care about most.</p>
<p>This shows the file's permissions, i.e., who can read, write, or execute it.</p>
<p>Let's have a closer look at one of those permission strings: </p>
<ul>
<li><code>-rwxr-xr-x</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first character tells us what type of thing this is: '-' means it's a regular file, while 'd' means it's a directory, and other characters mean more esoteric things.</p>
<p>The next three characters tell us what permissions the file's owner has.</p>
<p>Here, the owner can read, write, and execute the file: <code>rwx</code>.</p>
<p>The middle triplet shows us the group's permissions.</p>
<p>If the permission is turned off, we see a dash, so <code>r-x</code> means &quot;read and execute, but not write&quot;.</p>
<p>The final triplet shows us what everyone who isn't the file's owner, or in the file's group, can do.</p>
<p>In this case, it's 'r-x' again, so everyone on the system can look at the file's contents and run it.</p>
<p>To change permissions, we use the <code>chmod</code> command (whose name stands for &quot;change mode&quot;).</p>
<p>Here's a long-form listing showing the permissions on the final grades in the course Vlad is teaching:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls -l final.grd
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">-rwxrwxrwx 1 vlad bio  4215  2010-08-29 22:30 final.grd
</code></pre>
<p>Whoops: everyone in the world can read it; and what's worse, modify it! (They could also try to run the grades file as a program, which would almost certainly not work.)</p>
<p>The command to change the owner's permissions to <code>rw-</code> is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ chmod u=rw final.grd
</code></pre>
<p>The 'u' signals that we're changing the privileges of the user (i.e., the file's owner),
and <code>rw</code> is the new set of permissions.</p>
<p>A quick <code>ls -l</code> shows us that it worked, because the owner's permissions are now set to read and write:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls -l final.grd
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">-rw-rwxrwx 1 vlad bio  4215  2010-08-30 08:19 final.grd
</code></pre>
<p>Let's run <code>chmod</code> again to give the group read-only permission:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ chmod g=r final.grd
$ ls -l final.grd
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">-rw-r--rw- 1 vlad bio  4215  2010-08-30 08:19 final.grd
</code></pre>
<p>And finally, let's give &quot;all&quot; (everyone on the system who isn't the file's owner or in its group) no permissions at all:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ chmod a= final.grd
$ ls -l final.grd
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">-rw-r----- 1 vlad bio  4215  2010-08-30 08:20 final.grd
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the 'a' signals that we're changing permissions for &quot;all&quot;, and since there's nothing on the right of the &quot;=&quot;, &quot;all&quot;'s new permissions are empty.</p>
<p>We can search by permissions, too.</p>
<p>Here, for example, we can use <code>-type f -perm -u=x</code> to find files that the user can execute:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ find . -type f -perm -u=x
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">./tools/format
./tools/stats
</code></pre>
<p>Before we go any further, let's run <code>ls -a -l</code> to get a long-form listing that includes directory entries that are normally hidden:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls -a -l
</code></pre>
<p>Output</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">drwxr-xr-x 1 vlad bio     0  2010-08-14 09:55 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 vlad bio  8192  2010-08-27 23:11 ..
-rw-rw-r-- 1 vlad bio  1158  2010-07-11 08:22 safety.txt
-rwxr-xr-x 1 vlad bio 31988  2010-07-23 20:04 setup
-rw-rw-r-- 1 vlad bio  2312  2010-07-11 08:23 waiver.txt
</code></pre>
<p>The permissions for <code>.</code> and <code>..</code> (this directory and its parent) start with a 'd'.</p>
<p>But look at the rest of their permissions: the 'x' means that &quot;execute&quot; is turned on.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>A directory isn't a program; how can we &quot;run&quot; it?</p>
<p>In fact, 'x' means something different for directories.</p>
<p>It gives someone the right to <em>traverse</em> the directory, but not to look at its contents.</p>
<p>The distinction is subtle, so let's have a look at an example.</p>
<p>Vlad's home directory has three subdirectories called <code>venus</code>, <code>mars</code>, and <code>pluto</code>:</p>
<p><img src="Shell_Extras/./fig/x-for-directories.svg" alt="execute" /></p>
<p>Each of these has a subdirectory in turn called <code>notes</code>, and those sub-subdirectories contain various files.</p>
<p>If a user's permissions on <code>venus</code> are 'r-x', then if she tries to see the contents of <code>venus</code> and <code>venus/notes</code> using <code>ls</code>, the computer lets her see both.
If her permissions on <code>mars</code> are just 'r--', then she is allowed to read the contents of both <code>mars</code> and <code>mars/notes</code>.</p>
<p>But if her permissions on <code>pluto</code> are only '--x', she cannot see what's in the <code>pluto</code> directory:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ls pluto</code> will tell her she doesn't have permission to view its contents.</li>
</ul>
<p>If she tries to look in <code>pluto/notes</code>, though, the computer will let her do that.</p>
<p>She's allowed to go through <code>pluto</code>, but not to look at what's there.</p>
<p>This trick gives people a way to make some of their directories visible to the world as a whole without opening up everything else.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-windows"><a class="header" href="#what-about-windows">What about Windows?</a></h2>
<p>Those are the basics of permissions on Unix.</p>
<p>As we said at the outset, though, things work differently on Windows.</p>
<p>There, permissions are defined by <a href="Shell_Extras/./references.html#access-control-lists">access control lists</a>, or ACLs.</p>
<p>An ACL is a list of pairs, each of which combines a &quot;who&quot; with a &quot;what&quot;.</p>
<p>For example, you could give the Mummy permission to append data to a file without giving  him permission to read or delete it, and give Frankenstein permission to delete a file without being able to see what it contains.</p>
<p>This is more flexible that the Unix model, but it's also more complex to administer and understand on small systems.</p>
<p>(If you have a large computer system, <em>nothing</em> is easy to administer or understand.)</p>
<p>Some modern variants of Unix support ACLs as well as the older read-write-execute permissions, but hardly anyone uses them.</p>
<h2 id="challenge"><a class="header" href="#challenge">Challenge</a></h2>
<p>If <code>ls -l myfile.php</code> returns the following details:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">-rwxr-xr-- 1 caro zoo  2312  2014-10-25 18:30 myfile.php

<hr />
<p>The shell-novice lesson explained how we run programs or scripts from the shell's command line.</p>
<p>We'll now take a look at how to control programs <em>once they're running</em>. This is called <a href="Shell_Extras/./references.html#job-control">job control</a>, and while it's less important today than it was back in the Dark Ages, it is coming back into its own as more people begin to leverage the power of computer networks.</p>
<p>When we talk about controlling programs, what we really mean is  controlling <em>processes</em>. As we said earlier, a process is just a program  that's in memory and executing. Some of the processes on your computer are yours: </p>
<ul>
<li>they're running programs you explicitly asked for, like your web browser. </li>
</ul>
<p>Many others belong to the operating system that manages your computer for you, or, if you're on a shared machine, to other users.</p>
<h2 id="the-ps-command"><a class="header" href="#the-ps-command">The <code>ps</code> command</a></h2>
<p>You can use the <code>ps</code> command to list processes, just as you use <code>ls</code> to list files and directories.</p>
<h2 id="behaviour-of-the-ps-command"><a class="header" href="#behaviour-of-the-ps-command">Behaviour of the <code>ps</code> command</a></h2>
<p>The <code>ps</code> command has a swathe of option flags that control its behaviour and, what's more, the sets of flags and default behaviour vary across different platforms.</p>
<p>A bare invocation of <code>ps</code> only shows you basic information about <em>your</em>, <em>active</em> processes.</p>
<p>After that, this is a command that it is worth reading the '<code>man</code> page' for.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ps
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">  PID TTY          TIME CMD
12767 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
15283 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
</code></pre>
<p>At the time you ran the <code>ps</code> command, you had two active processes, your  (<code>bash</code>) shell and the  (<code>ps</code>) command  you had invoked in it.</p>
<p>Chances are that you were aware of that information, without needing to run a command to tell you it, so let's try and put some flesh on that bare bones information.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ps -f
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
vlad     12396 25397  0 14:28 pts/0    00:00:00 ps -f
vlad     25397 25396  0 12:49 pts/0    00:01:39 bash
</code></pre>
<p>In case you haven't had time to do a <code>man ps</code> yet, be aware that the <code>-f</code> flag doesn't stand for &quot;flesh on the bones&quot; but for &quot;Do full-format listing&quot;, although even then, there are &quot;fuller&quot; versions of the <code>ps</code> output.</p>
<p>But what are we being told here?</p>
<p>Every process has a unique process id (<code>PID</code>). Remember, this is a property of the process, not of the program that process is executing:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you are running three instances of your browser at once, each will have its own process <code>ID</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The third column in this listing, <code>PPID</code>, shows the <code>ID</code> of each process's parent. Every process on a computer is spawned by another, which is its parent (except, of course, for the bootstrap process that runs automatically when the computer starts up).</p>
<p>Clearly, the <code>ps -f</code> that was run is a child process of the (<code>bash</code>) shell it was invoked in.</p>
<p>Column 1 shows the <code>username</code> of the <code>user</code> the processes are being run by. This is the username the computer uses when checking permissions:</p>
<ul>
<li>each process is allowed to access exactly the same things as the user running it, no more, no less.</li>
</ul>
<p>Column 5, <code>STIME</code>, shows when the process started running, whilst Column 7, <code>TIME</code>, shows you how much time process has used, whilst Column 8, <code>CMD</code>, shows what program the process is executing.</p>
<p>Column 6, <code>TTY</code>, shows the ID of the terminal this process is running in. </p>
<p>Once upon a time, this really would have been a terminal connected to a central timeshared computer. It isn't as important these days, except that if a process is a system service, such as a network monitor, <code>ps</code> will display a question mark for its terminal, since it doesn't actually have one.</p>
<p>The fourth column, <code>C</code>, is an indication of the perCentage of processor
utilization.</p>
<p>Your version of <code>ps</code> may show more or fewer columns, or may show them in a different order, but the same information is generally available everywhere, and the column headers are generally consistent.</p>
<h2 id="stopping-pausing-resuming-and-backgrounding-processes"><a class="header" href="#stopping-pausing-resuming-and-backgrounding-processes">Stopping, pausing, resuming, and backgrounding, processes</a></h2>
<p>The shell provides several commands for stopping, pausing, and resuming processes. To see them in action, let's run our <code>analyze</code> program on our latest data files. After a few minutes go by, we realize that this is going to take a while to finish. Being impatient, we kill the process by typing <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>. This stops the currently-executing program right away.</p>
<p>Any results it had calculated, but not written to disk, are lost.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ./analyze results*.dat
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">...a few minutes pass...
^C
</code></pre>
<p>Let's run that same command again, with an ampersand <code>&amp;</code> at the end of the line to tell the shell we want it to run in the <a href="Shell_Extras/./references.html#background">background</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ./analyze results*.dat &amp;
</code></pre>
<p>When we do this, the shell launches the program as before. Instead of leaving our keyboard and screen connected to the program's standard input and output, though, the shell hangs onto them. This means the shell can give us a fresh command prompt, and start running other commands, right away. Here, for example, we're putting some parameters for the next run of the program in a file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cat &gt; params.txt
density: 22.0
viscosity: 0.75
^D
</code></pre>
<p>(Remember, ^D is the shell's way of showing Control-D, which means &quot;end of input&quot;.)</p>
<p>Now let's run the <code>jobs</code> command, which tells us what processes are currently running in the background:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ jobs
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">[1] ./analyze results01.dat results02.dat results03.dat
</code></pre>
<p>Since we're about to go and get coffee, we might as well use the foreground command, <code>fg</code>, to bring our background job into the foreground:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ fg
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">...a few minutes pass...
</code></pre>
<p>When <code>analyze</code> finishes running, the shell gives us a fresh prompt as usual. If we had several jobs running in the background, we could control which one we brought to the foreground using <code>fg %1</code>, <code>fg %2</code>, and so on. The IDs are <em>not</em> the process IDs. Instead, they are the job IDs displayed by the <code>jobs</code> command.</p>
<p>The shell gives us one more tool for job control: if a process is already running in the foreground, <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> will pause it and return control to the shell. We can then use <code>fg</code> to resume it in the foreground, or <code>bg</code> to resume it as a background job.</p>
<p>For example, let's run <code>analyze</code> again, and then type <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd>. The shell immediately tells us that our program has been stopped, and gives us its job number:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ./analyze results01.dat
^Z
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">[1]  Stopped   ./analyze results01.dat
</code></pre>
<p>If we type <code>bg %1</code>, the shell starts the process running again, but in the background. We can check that it's running using <code>jobs</code>, and kill it while it's still in the background using <code>kill</code> and the job number. </p>
<p>This has the same effect as bringing it to the foreground and then typing
<kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ bg %1

$ jobs
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">[1] ./analyze results01.dat
</code></pre>
<p>...</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ kill %1
</code></pre>
<p>Job control was important when users only had one terminal window at a time. It's less important now: if we want to run another program, it's easy enough to open another window and run it there. </p>
<p>However, these ideas and tools are making a comeback, as they're often the easiest way to run and control programs on remote computers elsewhere on the
network. This lesson's <a href="Shell_Extras/./workremote.html">ssh episode</a> has more to say about that.</p>

<p>Bash allows us to customize our environments to fill our own particular needs.</p>
<h2 id="aliases"><a class="header" href="#aliases">Aliases</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes we need to use long commands that have to be typed over and over again.  Fortunately, the <code>alias</code> command allows us to create shortcuts for these long commands.</p>
<p>As an example, let's create aliases for going up one, two, or three directories.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">alias up='cd ..'
alias upup='cd ../..'
alias upupup='cd ../../..'
</code></pre>
<p>Let's try these commands out.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cd /usr/local/bin
upup
pwd
</code></pre>
<p>Output:.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">/usr
</code></pre>
<p>We can also remove a shortcut with <code>unalias</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">unalias upupup
</code></pre>
<p>If we create one of these aliases in a bash session, they will only last until the end of that session. Fortunately, bash allows us to specify customizations that will work whenever we begin a new bash session.</p>
<h2 id="bash-customization-files"><a class="header" href="#bash-customization-files">Bash customization files</a></h2>
<p>Bash environments can be customized by adding commands to the <code>.bashrc</code>, <code>.bash_profile</code>, and <code>.bash_logout</code> files in our home directory.  The <code>.bashrc</code> file is executed whenever entering interactive non-login shells whereas <code>.bash_profile</code> is executed for login shells.  If the <code>.bash_logout</code> file exists, then it will be run after exiting a shell session.</p>
<p>Let's add the above commands to our <code>.bashrc</code> file.</p>
<p>Be careful to append to <code>.bashrc</code>, with <code>&gt;&gt;</code>. for concatenate, rather than one <code>&gt;</code> which would overwrite.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">echo &quot;alias up='cd ..'&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
tail -n 1 ~/.bashrc
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">alias up='cd ..'
</code></pre>
<p>We can execute the commands in <code>.bashrc</code> using <code>source</code>, so this creates the alias <code>up</code> which we can then use in directory <code>/usr/local/bin</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">source ~/.bashrc
cd /usr/local/bin
up
pwd
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">/usr/local
</code></pre>
<p>Having to add customizations to two files can be cumbersome.  It we would like to always use the customizations in our <code>.bashrc</code> file,  then we can add the following lines to our <code>.bash_profile</code> file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">if [ -f $HOME/.bashrc ]; then
        source $HOME/.bashrc
fi
</code></pre>
<p>Furthermore, and what is seen as good practice it to have a seperate alias file which is sourced in a similar way.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">if [ -f $HOME/.bash_aliases ]; then
        source $HOME/.bash_aliases
fi
</code></pre>
<p>Within this file you could place</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">#GIT
alias gst=&quot;git status&quot;
alias ga=&quot;git add&quot;
alias gaa=&quot;git add .&quot;
alias gcm=&quot;git commit -m&quot;
alias gpl=&quot;git pull&quot;
alias gps=&quot;git push&quot;
gc ()
{
  git clone git@github.com:&quot;$1&quot;&quot;/&quot;&quot;$2&quot;
}

alias ls=&quot;lsd&quot;
alias layout=&quot;~/.config/i3/layouts/layout.sh&quot;
alias off=&quot;sudo shutdown -h now&quot;
alias cat=&quot;bat -p&quot;
alias cccu=&quot;cd ~/Universities/CCCU/&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, <code>alias cat=&quot;bat -p&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;alias cccu=&quot;cd ~/Universities/CCCU/&quot;&quot;</code>,<code>alias layout=&quot;~/.config/i3/layouts/layout.sh&quot;</code>,<code>alias ls=&quot;lsd&quot;</code>... will not work on your system unless you have the same packaged, file structure etc.</p>
<h2 id="customizing-your-prompt"><a class="header" href="#customizing-your-prompt">Customizing your prompt</a></h2>
<p>We can also customize our bash prompt by setting the <code>PS1</code> system variable. To set our prompt to be <code>$ </code>, then we can run the command</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">export PS1=&quot;$ &quot;
</code></pre>
<p>To set the prompt to <code>$ </code> for all bash sessions, add this line to the end of <code>.bashrc</code>.</p>
<p>Further <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/307701/how-to-customize-and-colorize-your-bash-prompt">bash prompt customizations</a> are possible. </p>
<p>To have our prompt be <code>username@hostname[directory]: </code>, we would set...</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">export PS1=&quot;\u@\h[\W]: &quot;
</code></pre>
<p>... where <code>\u</code> represents username, <code>\h</code> represents hostname, and <code>\W</code> represents the current directory.</p>

</details>
<hr />
<p>The shell is just a program, and like other programs, it has variables.
Those variables control its execution, so by changing their values you can change how the shell and other programs behave.</p>
<p>Let's start by running the command <code>set</code> and looking at some of the variables in a typical shell session:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ set
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">COMPUTERNAME=TURING
HOME=/home/vlad
HOMEDRIVE=C:
HOSTNAME=TURING
HOSTTYPE=i686
NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS=4
OS=Windows_NT
PATH=/Users/vlad/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin
PWD=/home/vlad
UID=1000
USERNAME=vlad
...
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, there are quite a few; in fact, four or five times more than what's shown here.</p>
<p>And yes, using <code>set</code> to <em>show</em> things might seem a little strange,
even for Unix, but if you don't give it any arguments, it might as well show you things you <em>could</em> set.</p>
<p>Every variable has a name.</p>
<p>By convention, variables that are always present are given upper-case names.</p>
<p>All shell variables' values are strings, even those (like <code>UID</code>) that look  like numbers.</p>
<p>It's up to programs to convert these strings to other types when necessary.</p>
<p>For example, if a program wanted to find out how many processors the computer had, it would convert the value of the <code>NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS</code> variable from a string to an integer.</p>
<p>Similarly, some variables (like <code>PATH</code>) store lists of values.</p>
<p>In this case, the convention is to use a colon ':' as a separator.</p>
<p>If a program wants the individual elements of such a list, it's the program's responsibility to split the variable's string value into pieces.</p>
<h2 id="the-path-variable"><a class="header" href="#the-path-variable">The <code>PATH</code> Variable</a></h2>
<p>Let's have a closer look at that <code>PATH</code> variable.</p>
<p>Its value defines the shell's <a href="Shell_Extras/./references.html#search-path">search path</a>, i.e., the list of directories that the shell looks in for runnable programs when you type in a program name without specifying what directory it is in.</p>
<p>For example, when we type a command like <code>analyze</code>, the shell needs to decide whether to run <code>./analyze</code> or <code>/bin/analyze</code>.</p>
<p>The rule it uses is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>the shell checks each directory in the <code>PATH</code> variable in turn, looking for a program with the requested name in that directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>As soon as it finds a match, it stops searching and runs the program.</p>
<p>To show how this works, here are the components of <code>PATH</code> listed one per line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">/Users/vlad/bin
/usr/local/git/bin
/usr/bin
/bin
/usr/sbin
/sbin
/usr/local/bin
</code></pre>
<p>On our computer, there are actually three programs called <code>analyze</code> in three different directories:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/bin/analyze</code>,</li>
<li><code>/usr/local/bin/analyze</code>,</li>
<li><code>/users/vlad/analyze</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the shell searches the directories in the order they're listed in <code>PATH</code>, it finds <code>/bin/analyze</code> first and runs that.</p>
<p>Notice that it will <em>never</em> find the program <code>/users/vlad/analyze</code> unless we type in the full path to the program, since the directory <code>/users/vlad</code> isn't in <code>PATH</code>.</p>
<h2 id="showing-the-value-of-a-variable"><a class="header" href="#showing-the-value-of-a-variable">Showing the Value of a Variable</a></h2>
<p>Let's show the value of the variable <code>HOME</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ echo HOME
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">HOME
</code></pre>
<p>That just prints &quot;HOME&quot;, which isn't what we wanted (though it is what we actually asked for).</p>
<p>Let's try this instead:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ echo $HOME
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">/home/vlad
</code></pre>
<p>The dollar sign tells the shell that we want the <em>value</em> of the variable rather than its name.</p>
<p>This works just like wildcards: the shell does the replacement <em>before</em> running the program we've asked for.</p>
<p>Thanks to this expansion, what we actually run is <code>echo /home/vlad</code>, which displays the right thing.</p>
<h2 id="creating-and-changing-variables"><a class="header" href="#creating-and-changing-variables">Creating and Changing Variables</a></h2>
<p>Creating a variable is easy; we just assign a value to a name using &quot;=&quot;:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ SECRET_IDENTITY=Dracula
$ echo $SECRET_IDENTITY
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">Dracula
</code></pre>
<p>To change the value, just assign a new one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ SECRET_IDENTITY=Camilla
$ echo $SECRET_IDENTITY
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">Camilla
</code></pre>
<p>If we want to set some variables automatically every time we run a shell, we can put commands to do this in a file called <code>.bashrc</code> in our home directory.</p>
<p>(The '.' character at the front prevents <code>ls</code> from listing this file unless we specifically ask it to using <code>-a</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>we normally don't want to worry about it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The &quot;rc&quot; at the end is an abbreviation for &quot;run control&quot;, which meant something really important decades ago, and is now just a convention everyone follows without understanding why.)</p>
<p>For example, here are two lines in <code>/home/vlad/.bashrc</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">export SECRET_IDENTITY=Dracula
export TEMP_DIR=/tmp
export BACKUP_DIR=$TEMP_DIR/backup
</code></pre>
<p>These three lines create the variables <code>SECRET_IDENTITY</code>, <code>TEMP_DIR</code>,
and <code>BACKUP_DIR</code>, and export them so that any programs the shell runs can see them as well.</p>
<p>Notice that <code>BACKUP_DIR</code>'s definition relies on the value of <code>TEMP_DIR</code>, so that if we change where we put temporary files, our backups will be relocated automatically.</p>
<p>While we're here, it's also common to use the <code>alias</code> command to create shortcuts for things we frequently type.</p>
<p>For example, we can define the alias <code>backup</code> to run <code>/bin/zback</code> with a specific set of arguments:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">alias backup=/bin/zback -v --nostir -R 20000 $HOME $BACKUP_DIR
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, aliases can save us a lot of typing, and hence a lot of typing mistakes.</p>
<p>You can find interesting suggestions for other aliases and other bash tricks by searching for &quot;sample bashrc&quot; in your favorite search engine.</p>

<p>Bash is the only shell scripting language permitted for executables.</p>
<p>Executables must start with <code>#! /usr/bin/env bash</code> and a minimum number of flags. Use <code>set</code> to set shell options so that calling your script as bash <code>script_name</code> does not break its functionality.</p>
<p>Restricting all executable shell scripts to bash gives us a consistent shell language that's installed on all our machines.</p>
<p>The only exception to this is where you're forced to by whatever you're coding for. One example of this is Solaris SVR4 packages which require plain Bourne shell for any scripts.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-shell"><a class="header" href="#when-to-use-shell">When to Use Shell</a></h2>
<p>Shell should only be used for small utilities or simple wrapper scripts.</p>
<p>While shell scripting isn't a development language, it is used for writing various utility scripts throughout any system. This style guide is more a recognition of its use rather than a suggestion that it be used for widespread deployment.</p>
<p>Some guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you're mostly calling other utilities and are doing relatively little data manipulation, shell is an acceptable choice for the task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If performance matters, use something other than shell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are writing a script that is more than 100 lines long, or that uses non-straightforward control flow logic, you should rewrite it in a more structured language now. Bear in mind that scripts grow. Rewrite your script early to avoid a more time-consuming rewrite at a later date. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When assessing the complexity of your code (e.g. to decide whether to switch languages) consider whether the code is easily  maintainable by people other than its author.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="shell-files-and-interpreter-invocation"><a class="header" href="#shell-files-and-interpreter-invocation">Shell Files and Interpreter Invocation</a></h1>
<h2 id="file-extensions"><a class="header" href="#file-extensions">File Extensions</a></h2>
<p>Executables should have no extension (strongly preferred) or a <code>.sh</code> extension. Libraries must have a <code>.sh</code> extension and should not be executable.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to know what language a program is written in when executing it and shell doesn't require an extension so we prefer not to use one for executables.</p>
<p>However, for libraries it's important to know what language it is and sometimes there's a need to have similar libraries in different languages. This allows library files with identical purposes but different languages to be identically named except for the language-specific suffix.</p>
<h2 id="suidguid"><a class="header" href="#suidguid">SUID/GUID</a></h2>
<p>Set owner User ID up on execution (SUID) Set Group ID up on execution SGID are <em>forbidden</em> on shell scripts.</p>
<p>There are too many security issues with shell that make it nearly impossible to secure sufficiently to allow SUID/SGID. While bash does make it difficult to run SUID, it's still possible on some platforms which is why we're being explicit about banning it.</p>
<p>Use Super user do <code>sudo</code> to provide elevated access if you need it.</p>

<p>All error messages should go to STDERR.</p>
<p>This makes it easier to separate normal status from actual issues.</p>
<p>A function to print out error messages along with other status information is recommended.</p>
<p><code>$*</code> means all arguments passed into the function or script.</p>
<p>Additionally, you'll notice that the date is set to the ISO 8601 standard.</p>

<p>Using arrays can risk a script's complexity growing.</p>
<h3 id="array-decision"><a class="header" href="#array-decision">Array Decision</a></h3>
<p>Arrays should be used to safely create and pass around lists. In particular, when building a set of command arguments, use arrays to avoid confusing quoting issues. Use quoted expansion -- <code>&quot;${array[]}&quot;</code> -- to access arrays. However, if more advanced data manipulation is required, shell scripting should be avoided altogether.</p>
<h2 id="pipes-to-while"><a class="header" href="#pipes-to-while">Pipes to While</a></h2>
<p>Use process substitution or the <code>readarray</code> builtin (bash4+) in preference to piping to <code>while</code>. Pipes create a subshell, so any variables modified within a pipeline do not propagate to the parent shell.</p>
<p>The implicit subshell in a <code>pipe</code> to while can introduce subtle bugs that are hard to track down.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">last_line='NULL'
your_command | while read -r line; do
  if [[ -n &quot;${line}&quot; ]]; then
    last_line=&quot;${line}&quot;
  fi
done

# This will always output 'NULL'!
echo &quot;${last_line}&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Using process substitution also creates a subshell. However, it allows redirecting from a subshell to a <code>while</code> without putting the <code>while</code> (or any other command) in a subshell.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">last_line='NULL'
while read line; do
  if [[ -n &quot;${line}&quot; ]]; then
    last_line=&quot;${line}&quot;
  fi
done &lt; &lt;(your_command)

# This will output the last non-empty line from your_command
echo &quot;${last_line}&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, use the <code>readarray</code> <em>builtin</em> to read the file into an array, then loop over the array’s con-tents. Notice that (for the same reason as above) you need to use a process substitution with <code>readarray</code> rather than a <code>pipe</code>, but with the advantage that the input generation for the loop is located beforeit, rather than after.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">last_line='NULL'
readarray -t lines &lt; &lt;(your_command)

    last_line=&quot;${line}&quot;
  fi

echo &quot;${last_line}&quot;
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: Be cautious using a for-loop to iterate over output, as in for var in <code>$(...)</code>, as theoutput is split by whitespace, not by line. Sometimes you will know this is safe because theoutput can’t contain any unexpected whitespace, but where this isn’t obvious or doesn’timprove readability (such as a long command inside <code>$(...)</code> ), a <code>while</code> read loop or <code>readarray</code> is often safer and clearer.</p>

<p>Variables names for loops should be similarly named for any variable you're looping through.</p>

  something_with &quot;${zone}&quot;
done
</code></pre>
<h2 id="constants-and-environment-variable-names"><a class="header" href="#constants-and-environment-variable-names">Constants and Environment Variable Names</a></h2>
<p>All caps, separated with underscores, declared at the top of the file.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash"># Constant
readonly PATH_TO_FILES='/some/path'

# Both constant and environment
declare -xr SYSTEMTOOL_SID='PROD'
</code></pre>
<p>Some things become constant at their first setting (for example, via <code>getopts</code>). Thus, it's OK to set a constant in <code>getopts</code> or based on a condition, but
it should be made <code>readonly</code> immediately afterwards. For the sake of clarity <code>readonly</code> or export is recommended instead of the equivalent declare commands.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">VERBOSE='false'

<h2 id="read-only-variables"><a class="header" href="#read-only-variables">Read-only Variables</a></h2>
<p>Use <code>readonly</code> or <code>declare -r</code> to ensure they're read only.</p>
<p>As globals are widely used in shell, it's important to catch errors when working with them. When you declare a variable that is meant to be read-only, make this explicit.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">zip_version=&quot;$(dpkg --status zip | grep Version: | cut -d ' ' -f 2)&quot;
if [[ -z &quot;${zip_version}&quot; ]]; then
  error_message
else
  readonly zip_version
fi
</code></pre>
<h2 id="use-local-variables"><a class="header" href="#use-local-variables">Use Local Variables</a></h2>
<p>Declare function-specific variables with <code>local</code>. Declaration and assignment should be on different lines.</p>
<p>Ensure that local variables are only seen inside a function and its children by using <code>local</code> when declaring them. This avoids polluting the global name space and inadvertently setting variables that may have significance outside the function.</p>
<p>Declaration and assignment must be separate statements when the assignment value is provided by a command substitution; as the <code>local</code> builtin does not propagate the exit code from the command substitution.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">my_func2() {
  local name=&quot;$1&quot;

  # Separate lines for declaration and assignment:
  local my_var
  my_var=&quot;$(my_func)&quot;
  (( $? == 0 )) || return

  …
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-bash">my_func2() {
  # DO NOT do this:
  # $? will always be zero, as it contains the exit code of 'local', not my_func
  local my_var=&quot;$(my_func)&quot;
  (( $? == 0 )) || return

  …
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="function-locations"><a class="header" href="#function-locations">Function Locations</a></h2>
<p>Put all functions together in the file just below constants. Don't hide executable code between functions. Doing so makes the code difficult to follow and results in nasty surprises when debugging.</p>
<p>If you've got functions, put them all together near the top of the file. Only includes, set statements and setting constants may be done before declaring functions.</p>
<h2 id="main"><a class="header" href="#main"><code>main</code></a></h2>
<p>A function called `` is required for scripts long enough to contain at least one other function.</p>
<p>In order to easily find the start of the program, put the <code>main</code> program in a function called main as the bottom most function. This provides consistency with the rest of the code base as well as allowing you to define more variables as <code>local</code> (which can't be done if the main code is not a function). The last non-comment line in the file should be a call to <code>main</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">main &quot;$@&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Obviously, for short scripts where it's just a linear flow, <code>main</code> is overkill and so is not required.</p>
<h1 id="calling-commands"><a class="header" href="#calling-commands">Calling Commands</a></h1>
<h2 id="checking-return-values"><a class="header" href="#checking-return-values">Checking Return Values</a></h2>
<p>Always check return values and give informative return values.</p>
<p>For unpiped commands, use <code>$?</code> or check directly via an if statement to keep it simple.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">if ! mv &quot;${file_list[@]}&quot; &quot;${dest_dir}/&quot;; then
  echo &quot;Unable to move ${file_list[*]} to ${dest_dir}&quot; &gt;&amp;2
  exit 1
fi

# Or
mv &quot;${file_list[@]}&quot; &quot;${dest_dir}/&quot;
if (( $? != 0 )); then
  echo &quot;Unable to move ${file_list[*]} to ${dest_dir}&quot; &gt;&amp;2
  exit 1
fi
</code></pre>
<p>Bash also has the <code>PIPESTATUS</code> variable that allows checking of the return code from all parts of a pipe. If it's only necessary to check success or failure of the whole pipe, then the following is acceptable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">tar -cf - ./* | ( cd &quot;${dir}&quot; &amp;&amp; tar -xf - )
if (( PIPESTATUS[0] != 0 || PIPESTATUS[1] != 0 )); then
  echo &quot;Unable to tar files to ${dir}&quot; &gt;&amp;2
fi
</code></pre>
<p>However, as <code>PIPESTATUS</code> will be overwritten as soon as you do any other command, if you need to act differently on errors based on where it happened in the pipe, you'll need to assign <code>PIPESTATUS</code> to another variable immediately after running the command (don't forget that <code>[</code> is a command and will wipe out <code>PIPESTATUS</code>).</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">tar -cf - ./* | ( cd &quot;${DIR}&quot; &amp;&amp; tar -xf - )
return_codes=( &quot;${PIPESTATUS[@]}&quot; )
if (( return_codes[0] != 0 )); then
  do_something
fi
if (( return_codes[1] != 0 )); then
  do_something_else
fi
</code></pre>
<h2 id="builtin-commands-vs-external-commands-subsecbuilt_cmds"><a class="header" href="#builtin-commands-vs-external-commands-subsecbuilt_cmds">Builtin Commands vs. External Commands {#subsec:Built_cmds}</a></h2>
<p>Given the choice between invoking a shell builtin and invoking a separate process, choose the builtin.</p>
<p>We prefer the use of builtins such as the <em>Parameter Expansion</em> functions in <code>bash(1)</code> as it's more robust and portable (especially when compared to things like <code>sed</code>).</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Prefer this:
addition=$(( X + Y ))
substitution=&quot;${string/#foo/bar}&quot;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Instead of this:
addition=&quot;$(expr &quot;${X}&quot; + &quot;${Y}&quot;)&quot;
substitution=&quot;$(echo &quot;${string}&quot; | sed -e 's/^foo/bar/')&quot;

<p>So like last week we are going to keep adding to our script we created
using on JupyterHub.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTICE</strong></p>
<p>Jupyterhub link here: <a href="https://jupyterhub.canterbury.ac.uk/">https://jupyterhub.canterbury.ac.uk/</a></p>

<li>
<p>Sign in with your CCCU Microsoft account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In launcher menu click Terminal and Bash</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once in terminal mode, either make a directory () called 'AOS' or  navigate to it if you did this last
time ().</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now create a file called with by writing into the terminal , if you  already have a from last week do
the following and then .</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to find more information about each command used, either use the <code>man &lt;cmd&gt;</code> or go to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/">https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/</a> and search for them here.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="script-header"><a class="header" href="#script-header">Script Header</a></h1>
<p>Once completed the script should output the following information to the terminal, as seen in below. Notice the run the script we use the <code>bash /path/to/script &lt;options&gt;</code> format.</p>
<p><img src="System_Statistics_Script/images/systemStats_output.PNG" alt="image" /></p>
<p>First of make sure your file looks like code shown below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">#! /usr/bin/env bash
# CREATED BY: Name
# Date created: todays
# Version 0.1
# this script is designed to gather system statistics
</code></pre>
<p>In shell scripting comments, where the compiler ignores these lines, is defined as <code>#</code>. The first line is special as it points to the directive of the interpreter for the scripting language you are using, in this case <code>bash</code>. We call the <code>!#</code>  a hash-bang, shebang, hash-pling etc. The idea is it makes the shell script more like an executable file.</p>
<h1 id="global-variables"><a class="header" href="#global-variables">Global Variables</a></h1>
<p>Next we are going to define some variables, in bash all variables are, unless you specify that they are by defualt, <strong>global</strong>. Using the convention that <strong>global</strong> variables are defined as <strong>UPPERCASE</strong>. Incontrast <strong>local</strong> variables are defined using the self title keyword <code>local</code> and are written in <strong>lowercase</strong>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">AUTHOR=&quot;Seb&quot;
VERSION=&quot;0.1&quot;
RELEASED=&quot;2022-02-09&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Remember that bash is very particular language and whitespaces mean something. So make sure that variable for example have no spaces. We are going to use these variables later when we call for the version information of the script.</p>
<h1 id="usage-function"><a class="header" href="#usage-function">Usage function</a></h1>
<p>Now we are going to write a function that when called will display a help message on the terminal about the script, as example see below.</p>
<p><img src="System_Statistics_Script/images/systemStats_output_usage.PNG" alt="image" /></p>
<p>To do this we need to write the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Display help message
USAGE(){
  echo -e $1
  echo -e &quot;\nUsage: systemStats [-c cores] [-D diskspace] [-i ipv4 address]&quot;
  echo -e &quot;\t\t   [-u cpu usage] [-v version]&quot;
  echo -e &quot;\t\t   more information see man systemStats&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Similarly to global variables our function name is upper case as this is global too. The subsequent lines use the command <code>echo</code>  to output
information to standard out, or in this case the terminal. When supplied with the argument <code>-e</code> we enable the use of escape character such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>\n</code> new line</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>\t</code> tab identation</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The first line in the function means that the first, <code>$1</code>, argument passed into this function. The following lines will print out on a new line every time the   content in side the <code>&quot; &quot;</code> is passed into the <code>echo -e</code> . This information will tell the user of the script what arguments the script takes and the arguments descriptiors.</p>
<h1 id="error-checking"><a class="header" href="#error-checking">Error Checking</a></h1>
<p>Next we are going to some basic error checking.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># check for arguments (error checking)
if [ $# -lt 1 ];then
    USAGE&quot;Not enough arguments&quot;
    exit 1
elif [ $# -gt 6 ];then
    USAGE &quot;Too many argurmnets supplied&quot;
    exit 1
elif [[ ( $1 == '-h') || ( $1 == '--help') ]];then
    USAGE &quot;Help!&quot;
    exit 0
fi
</code></pre>
<p>Conditional checks can be performed in many styles within bash, here we see two styles.</p>
<p>Firstly, <code>[ ]</code>, is the same as the <em>built-ins</em> <code>test</code> command. It supports single conditional checks, and subsequent checks must be performed in separate  brackets, separated by Boolean operators, <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code> doesn't support the NOT (<code>!</code>) operator. To invert a condition, use a <code>!</code>  outside the first bracket to use the shell's facility for inverting command return values.</p>
<p>Secondly, <code>[[ ]]</code> is bash-specific, though others shells may have implemented similar constructs. The operators <code>==</code>  and <code>!=</code>  apply bash pattern matching rules, see <strong>Pattern Matching</strong> in <code>man</code>. <code>bash</code> has a <code>=~</code> regex match operator allows use of parentheses and the <code>!</code>, <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code> logical operators within the brackets to combine subexpressions.</p>
<p>So back to first <code>if</code> condition and the first <code>elif</code> condition  and you can see that a check is made to see if the length of arguments,<code>$#</code> , is less than,<code>-lt</code>  and a separate check for greater than, <code>-gt</code>.</p>
<p>The final <code>elif</code> shows we are checking for a match in patterns that are <strong>not</strong> numeric. So the conditional check is comparative to see if <code>$1</code> matches either <code>-h</code> or <code>--helpS</code> .</p>
<p>Also, notice how we are using <code>exit 0</code> or <code>exit 1</code>, which indicates an error.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW MORE...?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Exit code 0 Success</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exit code 1 General &amp; miscellaneous errors, such as <em>divide by zero</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exit code 2 Misuse of shell built-ins Example: <code>empty_function()</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="the-arguments"><a class="header" href="#the-arguments">The Arguments</a></h1>
<p>Remember earlier when we typed out the we added information about our arguments for this script? Well now are going to do this and use another function for bash called <code>getopts</code> as seen in the <code>while</code> loop on the first line of the code below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW MORE..?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>getopts</code> processes the positional parameters of the parent command. In bash, this is stored in the 
shell variable.</p>
<p><code>mycmd -a argument1 -b argument b </code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the time that <code>mycmd</code> is running, the variable <code>$</code>contains the string:</p>
<p><code>-a argument1 -b &gt; argument2</code> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can use<code>getopts</code> to parse this  string for options and arguments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="language-bash">while getopts cDiuv OPTION
do
case ${OPTION}

c) CORES=$(cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/present)
   echo&quot;Cores=&quot;${CORES};;

esac
done
</code></pre>
<p>Breaking down this codes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <code>while</code> construct iterates over all arguments supplied via the scripts invocation. Where the inputs are matched against those specified as argument to <code>getopts</code> the <code>OPTION</code> variable  stores the first or current argument supplied by the user, and then proceeds to the next one once the <code>case</code> has been matched.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>case</code>  is the bash syntax for a <code>switch\case</code>statement, like you might have seen in <code>.NET</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first <em>case</em> that matches is executed when for example if  <code>OPTION == 'c'</code>. So if this is the case the code inside the case block is exectuted. In this example we are getting the number of cores the system has. Remember that <code>cat</code> is the Linux command for  concatenating a file for reading or writing to, you can see the expected output of this in the below image.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="System_Statistics_Script/images/cpu_cores.PNG" alt="image" /></p>
<ul>
<li>The second case, <code>D) DISKSPACES</code>, uses the command <code>df</code>, which reports on the file system disk space. Using the <code>-H</code> option we are asking the command to  print sizes in powers of 1000 (e.g., 1.1G). Below is an image of the first part of the command before the <code>|</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="System_Statistics_Script/images/df_-H.PNG" alt="image" /></p>
<ul>
<li>The second part of the command uses the <code>grep</code> command with the option <code>-w</code> which uses regex to select only those lines containing matches that form whole words, in this case <strong>overlay</strong>. An output of this is shown below.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="System_Statistics_Script/images/df_-H_grep.PNG" alt="image" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Finally, on this line of code the output of <code>df -H  | grep -w 'overlay' </code> is piped, <code>|</code> into <code>awk</code>. <code>awk</code> is another command that speicialises in textual data manipulation and is a very powerful tool. We are using it here to only get the fields 2, 3 and 4 (<code>$2 $3 $4</code>). </li>
</ul>
<p><img src="System_Statistics_Script/images/df_-H_grep_awk.PNG" alt="image" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The line that shows the case <code>i) IP</code> returns the IP address using the <code>hostame</code> comand with the option <code>-I</code> which specificaly retruns the class 4 address. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second to last case, <code>u) CPU_USAGE....</code> returns the current % of the CPU in use and idle. This section of code looks complex, but we are again using <code>grep</code> to return on the line of data that has the word CPU from the <code>/proc/stat</code> file. The output of the <code>grep</code> command will be piped into <code>awk</code> and <code>awk</code> performs so maths to deterime each of the following, CPU in used and CPU that is free(idle). See below for two stages of the command.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linuxhowtos.org/System/procstat.htm">https://www.linuxhowtos.org/System/procstat.htm</a> provides further information on the meaning of the fields returned.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="System_Statistics_Script/images/grep_proc_stat_awk.PNG" alt="images" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Penultimately, <code>v) echo -e ...</code> returns our saved global variables from earlier. These variables provide information about the version, authors etc of the script.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, <code>*)</code>, means all other options are bad and as such we should return this to the user using the <code>USAGE()</code> we made earlier.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Bash colours(colors) are implemented when used in conjunction with
octal/ANSI escape codes <code>\033[0;34m</code>, see <a href="https://www.shellhacks.com/bash-colors/">https://www.shellhacks.com/bash-colors/</a> for further explanation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a variable isn't set earlier on or later by some other process of the user bash lets you apply a default value in case of this: So, if the <code>LOGFILE</code> is not initialised then <code>LOGFILE:-&quot;$HOME/tmp/bash-logger/my-bash-logger.log&quot;</code> will apply the default  log file path location as <code>$HOME/tmp/bash-logger/my-bash-logger.log</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last line here, <code>LOG_VARS</code> is how we call a function in a bash script</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="individual-log-functions"><a class="header" href="#individual-log-functions">Individual Log Functions</a></h1>
<p>Now we are going to be creating the 8 of the syslog logging levels with
an additional 1 to turnoff logging:</p>
<p>| OFF  | ERROR  |  CRITICAL |
| DEBUG   | INFO  |  ALERT |
| NOTICE  |  WARNING |  EMERGENCY |</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Individual Log Functions
# These can be overwritten to provide custom behavior for different log levels

OFF()       { LOG_HANDLER_DEFAULT &quot;$FUNCNAME&quot; &quot;$@&quot;; }
DEBUG()     { LOG_HANDLER_DEFAULT &quot;$FUNCNAME&quot; &quot;$@&quot;; }
INFO()      { LOG_HANDLER_DEFAULT &quot;$FUNCNAME&quot; &quot;$@&quot;; }
NOTICE()    { LOG_HANDLER_DEFAULT &quot;$FUNCNAME&quot; &quot;$@&quot;; }
WARNING()   { LOG_HANDLER_DEFAULT &quot;$FUNCNAME&quot; &quot;$@&quot;; }
ERROR()     { LOG_HANDLER_DEFAULT &quot;$FUNCNAME&quot; &quot;$@&quot;; exit 1; }
CRITICAL()  { LOG_HANDLER_DEFAULT &quot;$FUNCNAME&quot; &quot;$@&quot;; exit 1; }
ALERT()     { LOG_HANDLER_DEFAULT &quot;$FUNCNAME&quot; &quot;$@&quot;; exit 1; }
EMERGENCY() { LOG_HANDLER_DEFAULT &quot;$FUNCNAME&quot; &quot;$@&quot;; exit 1; }
</code></pre>
<p>So again probably some new syntax and commands are standing out.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>$FUNCNAME</code> contains the names of shell functions on the execution call stack, it can store an array of functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>$@</code> expands into a list of separate parameters, where as <code>$*</code> is one  parameter consisting of all the parameters added together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hopefully you remember from other content you have learned at CCCU that <code>exit 0</code> and is explicit means no error, exit 1 is an error and is implicit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="helper-functions"><a class="header" href="#helper-functions">Helper Functions</a></h1>
<p>Here the we will have some helper functions to that include the actual log function and level and level name.</p>
<p>Instead of showing it all in one dump, we will do each one individually.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Helper Functions

# Outputs a log formatted using the LOG_FORMAT and DATE_FORMAT configurables
# Usage: FORMAT_LOG &lt;log level&gt; &lt;log message&gt;
# Eg: FORMAT_LOG CRITICAL &quot;My critical log&quot;
FORMAT_LOG() {
    local level=&quot;$1&quot;
    local log=&quot;$2&quot;
    local pid=$$
    local date=&quot;$(date &quot;$LOG_DATE_FORMAT&quot;)&quot;
    local formatted_log=&quot;$LOG_FORMAT&quot;
    formatted_log=&quot;${formatted_log/'%MESSAGE'/$log}&quot;
    formatted_log=&quot;${formatted_log/'%LEVEL'/$level}&quot;
    formatted_log=&quot;${formatted_log/'%PID'/$pid}&quot;
    formatted_log=&quot;${formatted_log/'%DATE'/$date}&quot; 
    echo &quot;$formatted_log&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>So the above code sets out how we want the log format to look like,<code>see the third line of code above</code> gives an example of usage. Below you can see the output on the
terminal when the <code>bash</code> is passed the <code>-x</code> option, like debugging.</p>
<p><img src="RFC_Logger/images/format_log.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>For example the above shows the output of <code>FORMAT_LOG</code> when the script is called using <code>bash -x ./rfclogger.sh</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Calls one of the individual log functions
# Usage: LOG &lt;log level&gt; &lt;log message&gt;
# Eg: LOG INFO &quot;My info log&quot;
LOG() {
    local level=&quot;$1&quot;
    local log=&quot;$2&quot;
    local log_function_name=&quot;${level^^}&quot;
    $log_function_name &quot;$log&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Only special functionality is the special characters on line <code>7</code> of the above code, <code>&quot;...${level^^}&quot;</code> where the caret symbols <code>^^</code> is shorthand for force to UPPERCASE the value in the variable <code>level</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Get the level value from level name
# Eg: LOG_LEVEL_VALUE &lt;DEBUG | INFO | ...&gt;
LOG_LEVEL_VALUE() {
    local level=&quot;${1}&quot;
    [ -z &quot;${LOG_LEVELS[$level]+isset}&quot; ] &amp;&amp; return 1
    echo &quot;${LOG_LEVELS[$level]}&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Only thing really to point out here is that <code>-z</code> checks to see if something is of length <strong>zero</strong>. The function <code>isset</code> checks checks whether a variable is set, which means that it has to be declared and is <strong>not</strong> NULL. Therefore, we can set value by default to <code>LOG_LEVELS</code> if the current <code>level</code> variable is NULL.</p>
<p><img src="RFC_Logger/images/log_level_val.PNG" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Again output shown when called with <code>bash -x</code></p>
<p>Next you are going to create function that gets the log name from the supplied numeric value.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Get log level name from numeric value.
# Eg: LOG_LEVEL_NAME &lt;0..7&gt;
LOG_LEVEL_NAME() {
    local level=&quot;&quot;
    local value=&quot;${1}&quot;
    for level in &quot;${!LOG_LEVELS[@]}&quot;; do
       [ &quot;${LOG_LEVELS[$level]}&quot; -eq &quot;${value}&quot; ] &amp;&amp; echo &quot;${level}&quot; &amp;&amp; return 0
    done
    return 1
}
</code></pre>
<h1 id="log-handlers"><a class="header" href="#log-handlers">Log Handlers</a></h1>
<p>We are almost there we a several more functions to write, some that are styling/formatting for colour capable terminals.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Log Handlers

# All log levels call this handler (by default...)
# logging behavior
# Usage: LOG_HANDLER_DEFAULT &lt;log level&gt; &lt;log message&gt;
# Eg: LOG_HANDLER_DEFAULT DEBUG &quot;My debug log&quot;
LOG_HANDLER_DEFAULT() {
    # From pipe
    if [ -p /dev/stdin ]; then
        local level=&quot;$1&quot;
        shift
        while read -r line; do
            args=()
            if [ -n &quot;$*&quot; ]; then
                args+=( &quot;$@&quot; )
            fi
            args+=( &quot;${line}&quot; );
            LOG_HANDLER_OUT &quot;$level&quot; &quot;${args[*]}&quot;
        done
    # Normal log
    else
        LOG_HANDLER_OUT &quot;$@&quot;
    fi
}
</code></pre>
<p>There appears to be a fair amount going on here, but rest assured the structure of the code and commands used therein are pretty much self explanatory. But as always here is an explanation for each key point.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the line with the <code>if</code> condition, <code>-p</code> is the the flag for pipe and is checking for a piped  instance in stdin. A note here <code>/dev/stdin</code> is unique because it is a symbolic link to <code>/proc/self/fd/0</code> and <code>/proc/self</code> is a symbolic link only seen by your running  process to its process-id. The <code>/proc</code> filesystem is a virtual (not real) file system which has the ability to show a different view to each process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>shift</code> is a BUILTIN command of the Bash shell. When executed, it shifts the positional parameters (such as arguments passed to a bash script) to the left, putting each parameter in a lower position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the next <code>if</code> condition checks to see if all arguments are <strong>not</strong>, <code>-n</code>, empty.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Below you will see an the output of the <code>if</code> statement in action.</p>
<p><img src="RFC_Logger/images/log_handler_defualt_pipe.PNG" alt="when called using" /></p>
<p>So now we have a function that will handle for colour (color) and non-colour (color) terminals. You can see that a check is made on the first <code>if</code> condition where <code>-eq</code> means equals and it is used for numerical comparison.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Used by LOG_HANDLER_DEFAULT to output the log
LOG_HANDLER_OUT(){
    local level=&quot;$1&quot;
    local formatted_log=&quot;$(FORMAT_LOG &quot;$@&quot;)&quot;
    if [ &quot;${LOG_COLOR_ENABLE}&quot; -eq &quot;1&quot; ]; then
            LOG_HANDLER_COLORTERM &quot;$level&quot; &quot;$formatted_log&quot;
    else
            LOG_HANDLER_TERM &quot;$level&quot; &quot;$formatted_log&quot;
    fi

    if [ &quot;${LOG_LOGFILE_ENABLE}&quot; -eq &quot;1&quot; ]; then
        LOG_HANDLER_LOGFILE &quot;$level&quot; &quot;$formatted_log&quot;
    fi
}
</code></pre>
<p>There is also a check for sending the log to a file on the filnal <code>if</code> statement.</p>
<p>The below code provides the functionality to match the level of logging to the colours defined correct colour.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Outputs a log to the stdout, colourised using the LOG_COLOR configurables
# Usage: LOG_HANDLER_COLORTERM &lt;log level&gt; &lt;log message&gt;
# Eg: LOG_HANDLER_COLORTERM CRITICAL &quot;My critical log&quot;
LOG_HANDLER_COLORTERM() {
    local level=&quot;$1&quot;
    local level_value=&quot;$(LOG_LEVEL_VALUE &quot;$level&quot;)&quot;
    local log=&quot;$2&quot;
    local color_variable=&quot;LOG_COLOR_$level&quot;
    local color=&quot;${!color_variable}&quot;
    log=&quot;$color$log$RESET_COLOR&quot;

    [ &quot;${LOG_LEVEL}&quot; -eq &quot;${LOG_LEVELS[OFF]}&quot; ] &amp;&amp; return 0
    [ &quot;${level_value}&quot; -gt &quot;$LOG_LEVEL&quot; ] &amp;&amp; return 0
    echo -e &quot;$log&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>What we see from the above is that the log message is preceded by a colour and then at the end of the log message colour is returned to default, achieved by line with <code>og=&quot;$color$log$RESET_COLOR&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, line with the code <code>[ &quot;${LOG_LEVEL}&quot; -eq &quot;${LOG_LEVELS[OFF]}&quot; ] &amp;&amp;return 0</code> performs a numerical comparison on the current <code>LOG_LEVEL</code>
to see if it matches the value OFF(8).</p>
<p>So we have four functions left...</p>
<p>Continuing with the handler theme, the next function is the <code>LOG_HANDLER_TERM</code>, essentially the same as the the <code>LOG_HANDLER_COLORTERM</code> but without the colour!</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Outputs a log to the stdout, without color
# Usage: LOG_HANDLER_TERM &lt;log level&gt; &lt;log message&gt;
# Eg: LOG_HANDLER_TERM CRITICAL &quot;My critical log&quot;
LOG_HANDLER_TERM() {
    local level=&quot;$1&quot;
    local level_value=&quot;$(LOG_LEVEL_VALUE &quot;$level&quot;)&quot;
    local log=&quot;$2&quot;

    [ &quot;${LOG_LEVEL}&quot; -eq &quot;${LOG_LEVELS[OFF]}&quot; ] &amp;&amp; return 0
    [ &quot;${level_value}&quot; -gt &quot;$LOG_LEVEL&quot; ] &amp;&amp; return 0
    echo -e &quot;$log&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Next function is the deals with the log file itself. Although line <code>locallevel=&quot;$1&quot;</code> is not used, it is good to store the argument for future use...</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Appends a log to the configured logfile
# Usage: LOG_HANDLER_LOGFILE &lt;log level&gt; &lt;log message&gt;
# Eg: LOG_HANDLER_LOGFILE NOTICE &quot;My critical log&quot;
LOG_HANDLER_LOGFILE() {
    local level=&quot;$1&quot;
    local log=&quot;$2&quot;
    local log_path=&quot;$(dirname &quot;$LOGFILE&quot;)&quot;
    [ -d &quot;$log_path&quot; ] || mkdir -p &quot;$log_path&quot;
    echo &quot;$log&quot; &gt;&gt; &quot;$LOGFILE&quot;
    LOG_ROTATION
}
</code></pre>
<p>Main things here are the checking if the file exists and if not create it as seen in lines <code>[ -d &quot;$log_path&quot; ] || mkdir -p &quot;$log_path&quot;</code>. Once the file and the message has been logged(line <code>echo&quot;$log&quot; &gt;&gt; &quot;$LOGFILE&quot;</code>) then the system will check to see if a rotation of logs is needed by calling the <code>LOG_ROTATION</code> function.</p>
<p>The <code>LOG_ROTATION</code> function will rotate the logs every 500 lines, you could modify this to change the value, line <code>if [[  ${log_size} -gt 500 ]];then</code>. </p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Rotates logs if current log is over 500 lines
LOG_ROTATION(){
    local log_size=$(wc -l $LOGFILE | awk '{print $1}')
    local count_log_files=$(ls ${LOGFILE%/*} | grep &quot;${LOGFILE##/*}.*.gz&quot; | wc -l )
    if [[ ${log_size} -gt 500 ]]; then
        if [ ${count_log_files} -gt 0 ]; then
            for ((i=${count_log_files}; i!=0; i--)); do
		            local n=$((${i}+1))
                    mv ${LOGFILE}.${i}.gz ${LOGFILE}.${n}.gz
            done
        fi
        gzip -c &quot;${LOGFILE}&quot; &gt; &quot;${LOGFILE}.1.gz&quot;
        echo &quot;&quot; &gt; ${LOGFILE}
   fi
}
</code></pre>
<p>Some explanation will be given for lines <code> local count_log_files=$(ls ${LOGFILE%/*} | grep &quot;${LOGFILE##/*}.*.gz&quot; | wc -l )</code> and <code>for ((i=${count_log_files}; i!=0; i--)); do</code>, the rest is self explanatory.</p>
<p>Line <code>local count_log_files=$(ls ${LOGFILE%/*} | grep &quot;${LOGFILE##/*}.*.gz&quot; | wc -l )</code> counts the number of files in the directory. First <code>ls</code> is passed the <code>LOGFILE</code> where only the directory remains <code>%/*</code>, then piped <code>|</code> into <code>grep</code> that the only looks for files that are <code>my-bash-logger.log.#.gz</code> where <code>#</code> is a number, this intern is piped to <code>wc</code> and the option <code>-l</code> will return the number of instances. </p>
<p>Line <code>for ((i=${count_log_files}; i!=0; i--)); do</code>, is a for loop in bash, this is one of several formats, we then decrement the total number of instances of a <code>...*.gz</code> files and then increment the actual file, (rotating).</p>
<p>Lastly, this final function, <code>unsets</code> all these <code>env</code> variables when called by the user.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Reset log variables to default values
LOG_RESET() {
    unset LOGFILE

<p>The first two things you'll want to do are install git and create a free GitHub account.</p>
<p>Follow the instructions <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">here</a> to install git (if it's not already installed). Note that for this tutorial we will be using git on the command line only. While there are some great git GUIs (graphical user interfaces), It's easier to learn git using git-specific commands first and then to try out a git GUI once you're more comfortable with the command. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>95% of other online git resources and discussions will also be for the command-line interface. </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you've done that, create a GitHub account <a href="https://github.com/join">here</a>, you should use your university email account, but choose a different password.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Git and GitHub</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A quick aside: git and GitHub are <strong>not</strong> the same thing. Git is an open-source, version control tool created in 2005 by developers working on the Linux operating system; GitHub is a company founded in 2008 that makes tools which integrate with git. You do not need GitHub to use git, but you cannot use GitHub without using git. There are many other alternatives to GitHub, such as GitLab, BitBucket, and “host-your-own” solutions such as gogs and gittea. All of these are referred to in git-speak as “remotes”, and all are completely optional. You do not need to use a remote to use git, but it will make sharing your code with others easier.</p>

<h2 id="step-1-create-a-local-git-repository"><a class="header" href="#step-1-create-a-local-git-repository">Step 1: Create a local git repository</a></h2>
<p>When creating a new project on your local machine using git, you'll first create a new repository (or often, 'repo', for short). </p>
<p>To use git we'll be using the terminal. If you don't have much experience with the terminal and basic commands, check out this tutorial (If you don’t want/ need a short history lesson, skip to step three.)</p>
<p>To begin, open up a terminal and move to where you want to place the project on your local machine using the cd (change directory) command. For example, if you have a 'projects' folder on your desktop, you'd do something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">❯ cd Documents/

~/Documents
❯ mkdir myfirstrepository

~/Documents
❯ cd myfirstrepository

~/Documents/myfirstrepository
</code></pre>
<p>To initialize a git repository in the root of the folder, run the <code>git init</code> command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">~/Documents/myfirstrepository
❯ git init
hint: Using 'master' as the name for the initial branch. This default branch name
hint: is subject to change. To configure the initial branch name to use in all
hint: of your new repositories, which will suppress this warning, call:
hint:
hint: 	git config --global init.defaultBranch &lt;name&gt;
hint:
hint: Names commonly chosen instead of 'master' are 'main', 'trunk' and
hint: 'development'. The just-created branch can be renamed via this command:
hint:
hint: 	git branch -m &lt;name&gt;
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/seb/Documents/myfirstrepository/.git/
</code></pre>
<p>Regardless of the output above, rename the current branch with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">myfirstrepository on master
❯ git branch -M main

myfirstrepository on main
❯
</code></pre>
<h2 id="step-2-add-a-new-file-to-the-repo"><a class="header" href="#step-2-add-a-new-file-to-the-repo">Step 2: Add a new file to the repo</a></h2>
<p>Go ahead and add a new file to the project, using any text editor you like or running a touch command. <code>touch newfile.txt</code> just creates and saves a blank file named <code>newfile.txt</code>. </p>
<p>Once you've added or modified files in a folder containing a git repo, git will notice that  the file exists inside the repo. But, git won't track the file unless you explicitly tell it to. Git only saves/manages changes to files that it tracks, so we’ll need to send a command to confirm that yes, we want git to track our new file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">
myfirstrepository on main
❯ touch compeng0001.txt

myfirstrepository on main
❯ ls
compeng0001.txt
</code></pre>
<p>After creating the new file, you can use the <code>git status</code> command to see which files git knows exist.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">❯ git status
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)
	compeng0001.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use &quot;git add&quot; to track)
</code></pre>
<p>What this basically says is, &quot;Hey, we noticed you created a new file called compeng0001.txt, but unless you use the <code>git add</code> command we aren't going to do anything with it.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>An interlude: The staging environment, the commit, and you</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the most confusing parts when you're first learning git is the concept of the staging environment and how it relates to a <code>commit</code>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary#:%7E:text=the%20repository%20owner.-,commit,who%20made%20them%20and%20when.">commit</a> is a record of what changes you have made since the last time you made a commit. Essentially, you make changes to your repo (for example, adding a file or modifying one) and then tell git to put those changes into a <code>commit</code>.</p>
<p>Commits make up the essence of your project and allow you to jump to the state of a project at any other <code>commit</code>.</p>
<p>So, how do you tell git which files to put into a <code>commit</code>? This is where the <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository">staging environment</a> or index come in. As seen in Step 2, when you make changes to your repo, git notices that a file has changed but won't do anything with it (like adding it in a commit).</p>
<p>To add a file to a commit, you first need to add it to the staging environment. To do this, you can use the <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-add"><code>git add &lt;filename]&gt;</code></a> command (see Step 3 below).</p>
<p>Once you've used the git add command to add all the files you want to the staging environment, you can then tell git to package them into a commit using the <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit"><code>git commit</code></a> command. </p>
<p>Note: The staging environment, also called 'staging', is the new preferred term for this, but you can also see it referred to as the 'index'.</p>

<p>Add a file to the staging environment using the <code>git add</code> command. </p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">myfirstrepository on main
❯ git add compeng0001.txt
</code></pre>
<p>If you rerun the <code>git status</code> command, you'll see that git has added the file to the staging environment (notice the &quot;Changes to be committed&quot; line). </p>

<p>To reiterate, the file has <strong>not</strong> yet been added to a commit, but it's about to be.</p>
<p>However, first we need to make sure we have some creditentials for the commit to log who and when.</p>
<p>First set your username:</p>

<p>Run the command <code>git commit -m &quot;Your message about the commit&quot;</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">myfirstrepository on main
❯ git commit -m &quot;init: This is my first commit&quot;

 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)

</code></pre>
<p>The message at the end of the commit should be something related to what the commit contains - maybe it's a new feature, maybe it's a bug fix, maybe it's just fixing a typo. Don't put a message like &quot;asdfadsf&quot; or &quot;foobar&quot;. That makes the other people who see your commit sad. Very, very, sad. Commits live forever in a repository (technically you can delete them if you really, really need to but it’s messy), so if you leave a clear explanation of your changes it can be extremely helpful for future programmers (perhaps future you!) who are trying to figure out why some change was made years later.</p>
<h2 id="step-5-create-a-new-branch"><a class="header" href="#step-5-create-a-new-branch">Step 5: Create a new branch</a></h2>
<p>Now that you've made a new commit, let's try something a little more advanced.</p>
<p>Say you want to make a new feature but are worried about making changes to the main project while developing the feature. This is where <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell">git branches</a> come in. </p>
<p>Branches allow you to move back and forth between 'states' of a project. Official git docs describe branches this way: ‘A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits.’ For instance, if you want to add a new page to your website you can create a new branch just for that page without affecting the main part of the project. Once you're done with the page, you can <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging"><code>merge</code></a> your changes from your branch into the primary branch. When you create a new branch, Git keeps track of which commit your branch 'branched' off of, so it knows the history behind all the files. </p>
<p>Let's say you are on the primary branch and want to create a new branch to develop your web page. Here's what you'll do: Run <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout"><code>git checkout -b &lt;my branch name&gt;</code></a>. This command will automatically create a new branch and then 'check you out' on it, meaning git will move you to that branch, off of the primary branch.</p>
<p>After running the above command, you can use the <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch"><code>git branch</code></a> command to confirm that your branch was created:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">myfirstrepository on main
❯ git checkout -b dev
Switched to a new branch 'dev'
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-sh">myfirstrepository on mainmerge
❯ git branch
* dev
  main
</code></pre>
<p>The branch name with the asterisk next to it indicates which branch you're on at that given time. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A note on branch names</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, every git repository’s first branch is named <code>master</code> (and is typically used as the primary branch in the project). As part of the tech industry’s general anti-racism work, some groups have begun to use alternate names for the default branch (we are using “primary” in this tutorial, for example). In other documentation and discussions, you may see “master”, or other terms, used to refer to the primary branch. Regardless of the name, just keep in mind that nearly every repository has a primary branch that can be thought of as the official version of the repository. If it’s a website, then the primary branch is the version that users see. If it’s an application, then the primary branch is the version that users download. This isn’t technically necessary (git doesn’t treat any branches differently from other branches), but it’s how git is traditionally used in a project.</p>
<p>If you are curious about the decision to use different default branch names, GitHub has an explanation of their change here: <a href="https://github.com/github/renaming">https://github.com/github/renaming</a></p>
<p>Now, if you switch back to the primary branch and make some more commits, your new branch won't see any of those changes until you <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge"><code>merge</code></a> those changes onto your new branch.</p>

<h2 id="step-6-create-a-new-repository-on-github"><a class="header" href="#step-6-create-a-new-repository-on-github">Step 6: Create a new repository on GitHub</a></h2>
<p>If you only want to keep track of your code locally, you don't need to use GitHub. But if you want to work with a team, you can use GitHub to collaboratively modify the project's code.</p>
<p>To create a new repo on GitHub, log in and go to the GitHub home page. You can find the “New repository” option under the “+” sign next to your profile picture, in the top right corner of the navbar:</p>
<div align=center>
<p><img src="myFirstRepository/./figures/step6-1.png" alt="" /></p>
</div>
<p>After clicking the button, GitHub will ask you to name your repo and provide a brief description:</p>
<div align=center>
<p><img src="myFirstRepository/./figures/step6-2.png" alt="" /></p>
</div>
<p>You will see your new repo has been created with some useful instructions on creating and pushing a repo. </p>
<div align=center>
<p><img src="myFirstRepository/./figures/step6-3.png" alt="" /></p>
</div>
<p>Go back to the terminal.</p>
<h2 id="security-and-authentication"><a class="header" href="#security-and-authentication">Security and authentication</a></h2>
<p>You need to create an ssh key to push and pull to your online storage/repo before we try to sync with the cloud. </p>

<p>Now that is done, we can actually push our work to the cloud. </p>
<h2 id="step-7-push-a-branch-to-github"><a class="header" href="#step-7-push-a-branch-to-github">Step 7: Push a branch to GitHub</a></h2>
<p>Now we'll <code>push</code> the commit in your branch to your new GitHub repo. This allows other people to see the changes you've made. If they're approved by the repository's owner, the changes can then be merged into the primary branch.</p>
<p>First create a reference to the online repo.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">myfirstrepository on dev
❯ git remote add origin git@github.com:CompEng0001/myFirstRepo.git
</code></pre>
<p>To push changes onto a new branch on GitHub, you'll want to run <code>git push origin yourbranchname</code>. GitHub will automatically create the branch for you on the remote repository:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">myfirstrepository on dev
❯ git push origin dev

 * [new branch]      dev -&gt; dev
</code></pre>
<p>Now go back to the main branch and lets make sure that is pushed to the cloud aswell.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">myfirstrepository on dev
❯ git checkout main
Switched to branch 'main'

myfirstrepository on main
❯ git push
fatal: The current branch main has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin main

<p>...then:</p>

 * [new branch]      main -&gt; main
branch 'main' set up to track 'origin/main'.

</code></pre>
<p>You might be wondering what that &quot;origin&quot; word means in the command above. What happens is that when you clone a remote repository to your local machine, git creates an alias for you. In nearly all cases this alias is called &quot;<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes">origin</a>.&quot; It's essentially shorthand for the remote repository's URL. So, to push your changes to the remote repository, you could've used either the command: <code>git push git@github.com:git/git.git yourbranchname </code>or <code>git push origin yourbranchname</code></p>
<p>(If this is your first time using GitHub locally, it might prompt you to log in with your GitHub username and password.)</p>
<p>If you refresh the GitHub page, you'll see note saying a branch with your name has just been pushed into the repository. You can also click the 'branches' link to see your branch listed there.</p>
<p>Now lets make a change locally in the <code>dev</code> branch.</p>

<h2 id="step-8-create-a-pull-request-pr"><a class="header" href="#step-8-create-a-pull-request-pr">Step 8: Create a pull request (PR)</a></h2>
<p>A pull request (or PR) is a way to alert a repo's owners that you want to make some changes to their code. It allows them to review the code and make sure it looks good before putting your changes on the primary branch.</p>
<p>This is what the PR page looks like before you've submitted it:</p>
<div align=center>
<p><img src="myFirstRepository/./figures/step8-1.png" alt="" /></p>
</div>
<p>And this is what it looks like once you've submitted the PR request:</p>
<p><img src="myFirstRepository/./figures/step8-2.png" alt="" />
You might see a big green button at the bottom that says 'Merge pull request'. Clicking this means you'll merge your changes into the primary branch..</p>
<p><img src="myFirstRepository/./figures/step8-3.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Sometimes you'll be a co-owner or the sole owner of a repo, in which case you may not need to create a PR to merge your changes. However, it's still a good idea to make one so you can keep a more complete history of your updates and to make sure you always create a new branch when making changes.</p>
<h2 id="step-9-merge-a-pr"><a class="header" href="#step-9-merge-a-pr">Step 9: Merge a PR</a></h2>
<p>Go ahead and click the green 'Merge pull request' button. This will merge your changes into the primary branch.</p>
<p><img src="myFirstRepository/./figures/step8-4.png" alt="" />
<img src="myFirstRepository/./figures/step8-5.png" alt="" />
<img src="myFirstRepository/./figures/step8-6.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>When you're done, I recommend deleting your branch (too many branches can become messy), so hit that grey 'Delete branch' button as well.</p>
<p>You can double check that your commits were merged by clicking on the 'Commits' link on the first page of your new repo.</p>
<p><img src="myFirstRepository/./figures/step8-7.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>You can also see the hash code of the commit on the right hand side. A hash code is a unique identifier for that specific commit. It's useful for referring to specific commits and when undoing changes (use the <code>git revert &lt;hash code number&gt;</code> command to backtrack).</p>
<p>Now back to the terminal.</p>
<h2 id="step-10-get-changes-on-github-back-to-your-computer"><a class="header" href="#step-10-get-changes-on-github-back-to-your-computer">Step 10: Get changes on GitHub back to your computer</a></h2>
<p>Right now, the repo on GitHub looks a little different than what you have on your local machine. For example, the commit you made in your branch and merged into the primary branch doesn't exist in the primary branch on your local machine.</p>
<p>In order to get the most recent changes that you or others have merged on GitHub, use the <code>git pull origin master</code>command(when working on the primary branch). In most cases, this can be shortened to <code>git pull</code>.</p>

<p>Yes. Merge bubbles aren't inherently bad. They allow you to revert entire
features at a time. They get confusing and annoying to deal with if they cross
(commits interleave), so don't do that.</p>

<p>Be my guest. I've used gitflow and other similar models.After working in various teams, this is just what I've come to use. But next time you have to ask someone whether it is okay to push or pull from this or that branch.</p>
<h3 id="but-is-it-web-scale"><a class="header" href="#but-is-it-web-scale">But, is it <a href="http://mongodb-is-web-scale.com/">web-scale</a>?</a></h3>
<p>Friends claim more complex models are necessary for scaling large teams,
maintaining old releases, controlling information flow, etc. It very well may
be that using multiple mainlines (e.g. <code>develop</code>, <code>stable</code>, <code>release</code>, <code>v2</code>,
<code>tested</code>, etc) is exactly what fits your organization's constraints. That's
for you to decide, not me (unless we work together -- oh hi there!).</p>
<p>But you always have to wonder, &quot;shouldn't I use tags for that&quot;? For example,
tracking releases on a branch is a bit silly. A release commit can be tagged.
You can checkout a tag, just like any branch, or any commit, and do
whatever it is you need to do.</p>
<p>My guess is this relationship holds:</p>
<div align=center>
<p><img src="BranchingModel/./figures/commitsHeadless.png" alt="headless" /></p>
</div>
<p>So, perhaps taking five minutes to teach your team how to use <code>checkout</code> and
<code>tag</code> might save you more than 15% on car insurance.</p>

Yes, you may have to do this when contributing to open-source projects you

<h2 id="introduction-4"><a class="header" href="#introduction-4">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>OneFlow has been conceived as a simpler alternative to GitFlow. However, please don’t read “simpler” as “less able”. OneFlow’s branching model is exactly as powerful as GitFlow’s. There is not a single thing that can be done using GitFlow that can’t be achieved (in a simpler way) with OneFlow. The description below goes into more detail.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, OneFlow’s basic premise is to have one eternal branch in your repository. This brings a number of advantages (see below) without losing any expressivity of the branching model – the more advanced use cases are made possible through the usage of Git tags.</p>
<p>While the workflow advocates having one long-lived branch, that doesn’t mean there aren’t other branches involved when using it. On the contrary, the branching model encourages using a variety of support branches (see below for the details). What is important, though, is that they are meant to be short-lived, and their main purpose is to facilitate code sharing and act as a backup. The history is always based on the one infinite lifetime branch.</p>
<h2 id="oneflow-advantages"><a class="header" href="#oneflow-advantages">OneFlow advantages</a></h2>
<p>Maintaining a single long-lived branch simplifies the versioning scheme and day-to-day operations that developers have to perform considerably.</p>
<p>It also makes the project history cleaner and more readable, and thus more useful.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-oneflow"><a class="header" href="#when-to-use-oneflow">When to use OneFlow</a></h2>
<p>OneFlow is meant to be a drop-in replacement for GitFlow, which means it’s suitable in all situations that GitFlow is. In fact, you can quite easily migrate a project that is using GitFlow to OneFlow.</p>
<p>The main condition that needs to be satisfied in order to use OneFlow for a project is that every new production release is based on the previous release (GitFlow has exactly the same requirement). The vast majority of software projects fulfill that condition. If your project is a web application, for instance, then OneFlow should be a great fit. Most open-source projects could be versioned using OneFlow as well.</p>
<h2 id="when-not-to-use-oneflow"><a class="header" href="#when-not-to-use-oneflow">When NOT to use OneFlow</a></h2>
<p>While OneFlow is pretty flexible, it’s not suitable for every project. OneFlow will be a bad fit in basically the same circumstances that GitFlow would be. There are 2 main reasons why that might be the case.</p>
<p>First, when the above condition (“every new production release is based on the previous one”) is not satisfied. As an example, take the Python programming language. It has two incompatible versions, 2 and 3. Both of them receive bugfixes and security patches – however, that doesn’t mean a new release of Python 3 is based on the commit of the latest release of Python 2. The two versions have diverged, and while they surely share a lot of code, you can’t say that one is based on the other (talking from a purely version control perspective).</p>
<p>If your project needs to maintain multiple simultaneous yet incompatible release versions that way, then OneFlow won’t work for you out of the box. You can surely use elements of it – probably each individual version can be managed using OneFlow, for example. However, in these types of projects, the main challenge is usually in the interactions between the versions and how to effectively share code between them, and OneFlow was not designed to be a solution to that problem.</p>
<p>Second, if your project has a high degree of automation – uses Continuous Delivery, or even Continuous Deployment, for example – then this workflow will most likely be too heavy for you. Perhaps parts of it might still be useful, but other elements (like the release process, for instance) would have to be heavily modified to make sense when releasing on such a very frequent cadence.</p>
<h2 id="detailed-description"><a class="header" href="#detailed-description">Detailed description</a></h2>
<h3 id="the-main-branch"><a class="header" href="#the-main-branch">The main branch</a></h3>
<p>Like was explained before, the workflow uses only one eternal branch. The name doesn’t matter, and can be anything you want. We will use <code>master\main</code> in this description, as it’s probably the most common name, and is already a Git convention, but you can also use, for example, <code>current</code>, <code>default</code>, <code>mainline</code>, or anything else.</p>
<h3 id="feature-branches"><a class="header" href="#feature-branches">Feature Branches</a></h3>
<p>Feature branches (also sometimes called topic branches) are where the day-to-day development work happens – hence, they are by far the most common of all the support branches. They are used to develop new features and bugfixes for the upcoming release. They are usually named similarly to feature/my-feature.</p>
<div align=center>
<p><img src="OneFlow/./figures/feature-branch-with-labels.png" alt="" /></p>
</div>
<p>Feature branches often exist only in the developer’s repository, and are never pushed – however, if there are multiple people working on one feature, or if the feature will take a long time to develop, it’s typical to push them to the central repository (if only to make sure the code isn’t lost with a single disk failure).</p>
<h3 id="starting-a-feature-branch"><a class="header" href="#starting-a-feature-branch">Starting a feature branch</a></h3>
<p>To start a feature branch, simply create a new branch from <code>master</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ git checkout -b feature/my-feature master
</code></pre>
<h2 id="finishing-a-feature-branch"><a class="header" href="#finishing-a-feature-branch">Finishing a feature branch</a></h2>
<p>Once work on the given feature is done, it needs to be integrated back into <code>master</code>. There are several ways this can be accomplished.</p>
<p>Note: the choice of the feature branch integration method is immaterial as far as the workflow is concerned. It should be based on personal or team preference, however the branching model will work exactly the same, regardless of which option is chosen. My personal recommendation is to use option #1.</p>
<h2 id="option-1---rebase"><a class="header" href="#option-1---rebase">Option #1 - <code>rebase</code></a></h2>
<p>This method uses Git’s <code>rebase</code> command (with the <code>-i</code>, meaning interactive, switch) to integrate the feature branch with <code>master</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ git checkout feature/my-feature

$ git rebase -i master

$ git checkout master

$ git merge --ff-only feature/my-feature

$ git push origin master

$ git branch -d feature/my-feature
</code></pre>
<p>If you’re not yet well acquainted with the rebase command, I recommend <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History">this chapter</a> from the Pro Git SCM book.</p>
<p>Here’s a visual illustration of how that method works:</p>
<div align=center>
<p><img src="OneFlow/./figures/feature-branch-rebase-final.png" alt="" /></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Advantages of this method:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rebasing before integrating with <code>master</code> allows you to clean up the branch history before making it public, resulting in better final history landing on <code>master</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linear history makes things simpler and easier to find, especially when looking at the per-file history.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reverting the entire feature requires reverting multiple commits.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="option-2---merger--no-ff"><a class="header" href="#option-2---merger--no-ff">Option #2 - <code>merger -no-ff</code></a></h2>
<p>This is the method that GitFlow advocates.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">
$ git checkout master
$ git merge --no-ff feature/my-feature
$ git push origin master
$ git branch -d feature/my-feature
</code></pre>
<p>Visually:</p>
<div align=center>
<p><img src="OneFlow/./figures/feature-branch-merge-final.png" alt="" /></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Advantages of this method:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reverting the entire feature requires reverting only one commit (the merge commit).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The feature branch history, which is often messy, gets put directly on <code>master</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proliferation of merge commits (especially as the number of developers on a project grows) makes the history unmanageable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="option-3---rebase--merge--no-ff"><a class="header" href="#option-3---rebase--merge--no-ff">Option #3 - <code>rebase</code> + <code>merge -no-ff</code></a></h2>
<p>This method is a combination of the previous two, trying to keep their advantages while simultaneously getting rid of the disadvantages:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ git checkout feature/my-feature

$ git rebase -i master

$ git checkout master

$ git merge --no-ff feature/my-feature

$ git push origin master

$ git branch -d feature/my-feature

</code></pre>
<p>Visually:</p>
<div align=center>
<p><img src="OneFlow/./figures/feature-branch-rebase-and-merge-final.png" alt="" /></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Advantages of this method:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Clean and almost linear history.</li>
<li>Easy to revert an entire feature with one commit.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It’s difficult to enforce this method programmatically, so it has to rely on best-effort convention.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, regardless of the method used, if the feature branch was pushed to the central repository, you need to now remove it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ git push origin :feature/my-feature
</code></pre>
<h2 id="release-branches"><a class="header" href="#release-branches">Release branches</a></h2>
<p>Release branches are created to prepare the software for being released. Obviously, what exactly that means varies on a project-per-project basis. This could be as simple as bumping the version number in the configuration, or involve things like code freezes, producing Release Candidates, and having a full QA process. The important thing is all that happens on a separate branch, so that day-to-day development can continue as usual on <code>master</code>.</p>
<p>The naming convention for these is <code>release/&lt;version-number&gt;</code>.</p>
<h2 id="starting-a-release-branch"><a class="header" href="#starting-a-release-branch">Starting a release branch</a></h2>
<p>Release branches also start from master, however they often don’t start from the tip – instead, they have their origin in whatever commit on master you think contains all of the features that you want to include in the given release.</p>
<p>For example, here we start the branch for the version <code>2.3.0</code> release on a commit with the hash <code>9efc5d</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ git checkout -b release/2.3.0 9efc5d
</code></pre>
<h2 id="finishing-a-release-branch"><a class="header" href="#finishing-a-release-branch">Finishing a release branch</a></h2>
<p>Once whatever process you use for releasing is finished, the tip of the branch is tagged with the version number. After that, the branch needs to be merged into <code>master</code> to be versioned permanently:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ git checkout release/2.3.0

$ git tag 2.3.0

$ git checkout master

$ git merge release/2.3.0

$ git push --tags origin master

$ git branch -d release/2.3.0
</code></pre>
<p>Here’s a diagram illustrating the above commands (assuming the release took two commits):</p>
<div align=center>
<p><img src="OneFlow/./figures/release-branch-merge-final.png" alt="" /></p>
</div>
<p>Again, if you pushed the release branch to the central repository, you now need to delete it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ git push origin :release/2.3.0
</code></pre>
<h2 id="hotfix-branches"><a class="header" href="#hotfix-branches">Hotfix branches</a></h2>
<p>Hotfix branches are very similar to release branches – they result in a new version of the project being released. Where they differ is their intentions – while release branches signify a planned production milestone, hotfix branches are most often an unwanted but necessary exception to the usual release cadence, typically because of some critical defect found in the latest release that needs to be fixed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>They are named <code>hotfix/&lt;version-number&gt;</code>. Note that if you use <a href="http://semver.org/http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>, regular releases bump either the Major or Minor number, while hotfixes bump the Patch number.</p>
<p>Starting a hotfix branch
Hotfix branches are cut from the commit that the latest version tag points to. Continuing our example from the release branch:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ git checkout -b hotfix/2.3.1 2.3.0
</code></pre>
<h2 id="finishing-a-hotfix-branch"><a class="header" href="#finishing-a-hotfix-branch">Finishing a hotfix branch</a></h2>
<p>Finishing a hotfix branch is pretty much the same as finishing a release branch: tag the tip, merge it to <code>master</code>, then delete the branch.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ git checkout hotfix/2.3.1

$ git tag 2.3.1

$ git checkout master

$ git merge hotfix/2.3.1

$ git push --tags origin master

$ git branch -d hotfix/2.3.1
</code></pre>
<p>Here’s a visual illustration:</p>
<div align=center>
<p><img src="OneFlow/./figures/hotfix-branch-merge-final.png" alt="" /></p>
</div>
<p>There is one special case when finishing a hotfix branch. If a release branch has already been cut in preparation for the next release before the hotfix was finished, you need to merge the hotfix branch not to <code>master</code>, but to the release branch. Otherwise, the new release will bring back the original bug that the hotfix corrected. The fix will eventually get to <code>master</code> – when the release branch is merged back to it.</p>
<p>As always, if the hotfix branch was pushed to the central repository, you need to remove it now:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ git push origin :hotfix/2.3.1
</code></pre>
<h1 id="variation--develop--master"><a class="header" href="#variation--develop--master"># Variation – <code>develop</code> + <code>master</code></a></h1>
<p>There is one small wrinkle with the branching model described above. In order to find the latest production version of the code, you need to look at all of the tags in the repository, and checkout the latest one.</p>
<p>This problem has a very simple solution. You add another, ‘latest’, long-lived branch, whose only purpose is to point to the last released commit. Each time the version number is bumped, the ‘latest’ branch is fast-forwarded to the newly created tag.</p>
<p>So, that’s all great, but there is one small issue left. It would be very cool, especially for open-source projects, if the default branch that people got when cloning the repository was this ‘latest’ branch, which contains stable code, instead of the ‘working’ (what was called <code>master</code> in the above description) branch, which contains the work-in-progress on the yet-unreleased next version, which might not be very stable.</p>
<p>The simplest solution to this problem is to take advantage of the fact that <code>master</code> is the default branch in Git. So, we call the ‘latest’ branch <code>master</code>. However, that means we need to find a new name for the ‘working’ branch. In this description, we will re-use the GitFlow convention, and call it <code>develop</code> (of course, you are free to call it whatever you want in your project).</p>
<p>For clarity, I will show all of the workflow operations again, this time using this new naming. However, I want to emphasize that, other than a slight name change and the introduction of a new ‘marker’ branch, the workflow is exactly the same as was described above.</p>
<h2 id="the-main-branches"><a class="header" href="#the-main-branches">The main branches</a></h2>
<p>This variation uses two branches: <code>develop</code>, which plays the same role as <code>master</code> above, and <code>master</code>, which points at the latest release tag.</p>
<h2 id="feature-branches-1"><a class="header" href="#feature-branches-1">Feature branches</a></h2>
<p>Feature branches work exactly the same as already explained, except you need to substitute <code>master</code> with <code>develop</code> in the description above.</p>

<h2 id="hotfix-branches-1"><a class="header" href="#hotfix-branches-1">Hotfix branches</a></h2>
<p>Hotfix branches, because they result in publishing a new version as well, also require the additional step of fast-forwarding <code>master</code> to the newly created <code>tag</code>.</p>
<h3 id="starting-a-hotfix-branch"><a class="header" href="#starting-a-hotfix-branch">Starting a hotfix branch</a></h3>
<p>Because <code>master</code> always tracks the latest tag, creating a <code>hotfix</code> branch is a tiny bit easier in this variant (note however that you still need to look at the tags to determine what the previous version number was, in order to name your <code>hotfix</code> branch correctly):</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ git checkout -b hotfix/2.3.1 `master`

<h3 id="change-in-plan-pull-a-feature-from-a-release"><a class="header" href="#change-in-plan-pull-a-feature-from-a-release">Change in plan, pull a feature from a release</a></h3>
<p><strong>TBD: Discuss</strong>
Mike N: That probably means recreating the release branch, unless we have short-lived release branches</p>
<h3 id="supporting-old-releases"><a class="header" href="#supporting-old-releases">Supporting old releases</a></h3>
<p>In a release based project old releases can often need some maintenance. Critical bug fixes and strategic feature requests need to be supported on old releases. Old releases often become incompatible with the most recent versions of projects.</p>
<p>In order to support old release versions gitflow has introduced the concept of support branches. Support branches are long living branches created to support major or minor versions of the project. Support branches do not get merged back into <code>master</code> or <code>develop</code> (this would cause major merge issues which are time consuming and error prone if attempted). Instead commits can be cherry picked from the support branch back into <code>develop</code>. </p>
<p>Support branches can be thought of as the <code>master</code> branch for old releases. Support branches for major releases should be named as <code>support-v&lt;major&gt;.x</code>. Support branches for minor releases should be named as <code>support-v&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.x</code>.</p>
<p>Here is an example of creating a support branch for v1.0 assuming v2.0 of the project has already been released.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create the support branch and release branch for the patch release.</p>
<pre><code>// Checkout the tag for the 1.0.0 release
git checkout v1.0.0

// Create the long living support branch
git checkout -b support-v1.x

// Create the release branch
git checkout -b release-v1.0.1
</code></pre>
<p>Note: For subsequent releases (ex v1.0.2) the release branch will be branched off the <code>HEAD</code> of <code>support-v1.x</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make changes in the <code>release-v1.0.1</code>. Multiple PRs can be merged into this branch if several changes are necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As PRs are merged into the <code>release-v1.0.1</code> branch create associated PRs that cherry pick the changes back into <code>develop</code>. Ensure that these changes are desired by the team going forward and that they are compatible with the current state of the <code>develop</code> branch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create release PR to merge <code>release-v1.0.1</code> into <code>support-v1.x</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow the standard release process treating <code>support-v1.x</code> as the <code>master</code> branch. As per the standard release process <code>release-v1.0.1</code> will get deleted and <code>support-v1.x</code> will remain in repo indefinitely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mark <code>support-v1.x</code> as a protected branch in github so that it does not get accidentally deleted.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Pro-tip</em>: Try to maintain as few support branches as possible. These branches are expensive to maintain since you will need to cherry pick applicable bug fixes into each support branch seperately.</p>
<h3 id="production-hot-fix-1"><a class="header" href="#production-hot-fix-1">Production hot fix</a></h3>
<p>A production hotfix is very similar to a full-scale release except that you do
your work in a branch taken directly off of <code>master</code>. Hotfixes are useful in cases
where you want to patch a bug in a released version, but <code>develop</code> has unreleased
code in it already.</p>
<p><strong>TBD: Insert diagram</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create a hot fix branch based off of <code>master</code>.</p>
<pre><code>$ git checkout master
$ git checkout -b hotfix-documentation-broken-links
$ git push --set-upstream origin hotfix-documentation-broken-links

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

with the following branch settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Base: <code>master</code></li>
<li>Compare: <code>hotfix-documentation-broken-links</code>
Paste your release checklist into the PR and work through the PR to get the
hotfix into production.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>At some point in the checklist you will merge the hotfix branch into <code>master</code>.
You can do this by using the &quot;Merge pull request&quot; button on the release PR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that the hotfix code is in <code>master</code> you are ready to create the actual
release. Navigate to the project page on Github and draft a new release with
the following settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tag version: <code>vX.Y.Z</code></li>
<li>Target: <code>master</code></li>
<li>Release title: <code>Release vX.Y.Z (hotfix)</code></li>

</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Click <code>Publish release</code>.</p>
<p><em>Note: Hotfix releases <em>are</em> actual releases. You should bump at least the
patch part of the version when releasing a hotfix and so even hotfixes go
through the process of creating a release like this.</em></p>

<p>In case you’re connecting to a wifi run <code>iwconfig</code> to see what is the name of your wireless network interface. In case it’s <code>wlan0</code> replace <code>SSID</code> and <code>passphrase</code> with <code>makerspace</code> ```gkgV8jID`` your data and run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan0 -c &lt;(wpa_passphrase 'SSID' 'passphrase') &amp;
</code></pre>
<p>Once you see your terminal that connection is established, run <code>host nixos.org</code> to check the DNS resolves correctly.</p>
<p>In case you've made a typo, run <code>pkill wpa_supplicant</code> and start over.</p>
<h2 id="updating-the-firmware"><a class="header" href="#updating-the-firmware">Updating the Firmware</a></h2>
<p>To benefit from updates and bug fixes from the vendor, we will start by updating Raspberry Pi firmware:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ nix-shell -p raspberrypi-eeprom
$ mount /dev/disk/by-label/FIRMWARE /mnt
$ BOOTFS=/mnt FIRMWARE_RELEASE_STATUS=stable rpi-eeprom-update -d  
</code></pre>
<h2 id="installing-nixos"><a class="header" href="#installing-nixos">Installing NixOS</a></h2>
<p>For initial installation we'll install <a href="https://www.xfce.org/">XFCE</a> desktop environment with user <code>Guest</code> and <code>SSH daemon</code>.</p>
<p>The script below is below is a configuration file, remember that NixOS is a decalaritve system and that its root directories are immutable therefore we must <strong>configure -&gt; deploy -&gt; re-coonfigure -&gt; deploy ...</strong></p>
<p>Using you the <code>nano</code> text editor you enter the following command as <code>su</code>... <code>nano /etc/nixos/configuration.nix</code> </p>
<pre><code class="language-nix">{config, pkgs, lib, ... }:

let
  user = &quot;guest&quot;;
  password = &quot;guest&quot;;
  SSID = &quot;makerspace&quot;;
  SSIDpassword = &quot;gkgV8jID&quot;;
  interface = &quot;wlan0&quot;;
  hostname = &quot;myhostname&quot;;
in {
  imports = [&quot;${fetchTarball &quot;https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-hardware/archive/936e4649098d6a5e0762058cb7687be1b2d90550.tar.gz&quot; }/raspberry-pi/4&quot;];

  fileSystems = {
    &quot;/&quot; = {
      device = &quot;/dev/disk/by-label/NIXOS_SD&quot;;
      fsType = &quot;ext4&quot;;
      options = [ &quot;noatime&quot; ];
    };
  };

  networking = {
    hostName = hostname;
    wireless = {
      enable = true;
      networks.&quot;${SSID}&quot;.psk = SSIDpassword;
      interfaces = [ interface ];
    };
  };

  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ vim ];

  services.openssh.enable = true;

  users = {
    mutableUsers = false;
    users.&quot;${user}&quot; = {
      isNormalUser = true;
      password = password;
      extraGroups = [ &quot;wheel&quot; ];
    };
  };

  # Enable GPU acceleration
  hardware.raspberry-pi.&quot;4&quot;.fkms-3d.enable = true;

  services.xserver = {
    enable = true;
    displayManager.lightdm.enable = true;
    desktopManager.xfce.enable = true;
  };

  hardware.pulseaudio.enable = true;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Of course if you have already read past the configuration above then you could always save some much needed time and do this in the terminal as <code>su</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ curl -L https://tinyurl.com/nixos-rpi4-tutorial &gt; /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
</code></pre>
<p>At the top of <code>/etc/nixos/configuration.nix</code> there are a few variables that you want to configure, most important being your wifi connection details, this time specified in declarative way.</p>
<p>Once you're ready to deploy your first configuration file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ nixos-install --root /
$ reboot
</code></pre>
<h2 id="making-changes"><a class="header" href="#making-changes">Making Changes</a></h2>
<p>It booted, congratulations!</p>
<p>To make further changes to the configuration, search through <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options">NixOS options</a>, edit <code>/etc/nixos/configuration.nix</code> and update your system.</p>
<p>However, we are going to make some changes to the configuration file now and redeploy. Re-open <code>/etc/nixos/configuration.nix</code>. We need to change the keymapping, locale and dateTime, navigate to the line above <code>networking = {</code> and add the following configuration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nix">time.timeZone = &quot;Europe/London&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>Then find the line <code>services.openssh.enable = true;</code> and creat a new line underneath and enter the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nix">i18n.defaultLocale = &quot;en_GB.UTF-8&quot;;
console = {
	font = &quot;Lat2-Terminus16&quot;;
	keyMap = &quot;uk&quot;;
};
</code></pre>
<p>Next we are going to declaratively set the CPU governor, navigate to where the script has the line <code>hardware.raspberry.pi.&quot;4&quot;.fkms-3d.enable = true;</code> and create a new line and enter the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nix">powerManagement.cpuFreqGovernor = &quot;powersave&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>Next modify the services.xserver to look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nix">services.xserver ={
	enable = true;
	layout = &quot;gb&quot;;
};
</code></pre>
<p>Now write out so we can redeploy our script live.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ sudo -i
$ nixos-rebuild switch
$ reboot
</code></pre>
<p>Once rebooted you will be presented with several bootable generations, default is which ever generation is set as default (We will revisit this shortly). From here it is possible to role back or leap forward to the latest configuration. This is a really powerful feature of NixOS.</p>
<p>Now let's try something else. </p>
<p>Again let's open the configuration file again, make sure you are root.</p>
<p>We are going to change the displayManager and the desktopManager, navigate to the <code>services.xserver ={</code> line and modify:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nix">services.xserver = {
	enable = true;
	layout = &quot;gb&quot;;
	#displayManager.lightdm.enable = true;
	displayManager.sddm.enable = true;
	#desktopManager.xfce.enable = false;
	desktopManager.plasma5.enable = true;
</code></pre>
<p>Write out and enter redeploy and reboot with the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ sudo nixos-rebuild switch &amp;&amp; reboot
</code></pre>
<p>or if root already remove the <code>sudo</code> command.</p>
<p>Once rebooted and you should see a the <code>sddm</code> login screen instead of <code>lightdm</code> and the <code>plasma5</code> desktop environment instead of <code>xfce</code>.</p>
<p>Lets try another...</p>
<pre><code class="language-nix">services.xserver = {
	enable = true;
	layout = &quot;gb&quot;;
	#displayManager.lightdm.enable = true;
	#displayManager.sddm.enable = true;
	displayManager.xpra.enable = true;
	#desktopManager.xfce.enable = false;
	#desktopManager.plasma5.enable = true;
	desktopManager.lumina.enable = true;
</code></pre>
<p>Write out and enter redeploy and reboot with the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ sudo nixos-rebuild switch &amp;&amp; reboot
</code></pre>
<p>or if root already remove the <code>sudo</code> command.</p>
<p>Now we should have a new display and desktop manager, how fun, however what you should be noticing is an increase in configurations... these take up space on the system and we should clear those we don't want, but not yet.</p>
<p>If you open the terminal and run this command you should see a list of configurations files, notice that the lastest is current set to (current) this is so you know which generation you are running : </p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ sudo nix-env --list-generations --profile /nix/var/nix/profiles/system
</code></pre>
<p>Ok we are now going to modify the environment imperatively.</p>
<p>Using the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ nix-env -iA nixos.bat
</code></pre>
<p><code>bat</code> is a  <code>cat</code> clone with syntax highlighting and git integration including beautification.</p>
<p>Once installed, do this <code>bat /etc/os-release</code> and do the same with <code>cat</code> see the difference? Now because we did this imperatively if we took the configuration file to a new system or needed to rebuild from scratch this system, these two new packages would not be included. So to make a modification to the configuration file. Naviagate to the <code>environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ vim ];</code>, lets get some more packages: </p>
<pre><code class="language-nix">environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ vim git bat vscodium neofetch ];
</code></pre>
<p>Write out and enter redeploy and reboot with the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ sudo nixos-rebuild  &amp;&amp; reboot
</code></pre>
<p>or if root already remove the <code>sudo</code> command.</p>

<p>First thing to note, Arch Linux <strong>doesn’t</strong> support <strong>ARM architecture</strong> (used by devices like Raspberry Pi) officially. But there is a separate project called <strong>Arch Linux ARM</strong> that ports Arch Linux to ARM devices. It is available in both 32-bit &amp; 64-bit format.</p>
<p>Since the installation procedure is purely terminal-based, you will develop an itermediate knowledge of the Linux command line and you should be comfortable in using terminal! </p>
